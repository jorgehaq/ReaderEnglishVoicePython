1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,570
So, what do we got?

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,213
Terry Colby was involved in the cover-up

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,788
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,174
What do we need to prove our case?

5
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:14,010
Someone who was there
when the decision was made

6
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:16,346
to falsify chemical waste intel.

7
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,848
Get the hell away from my
home. Get away from my home!

8
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,217
Elliot, what is going on with you?

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,803
I cannot help you if
you keep me in the dark.

10
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:25,054
We got problems.

11
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,890
The Dark Army is bailing.

12
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,191
It's not over.

13
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,226
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

14
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:33,229
How do you not blow your
brains out married to him?

15
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,731
You want to watch me piss too?

16
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:38,067
- Scott, a misunderstanding...
- Happy to pull my dick out for you.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,819
Elliot!

18
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,740
- Where is she?
- I told you you'd get her back, bro.

19
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,025
Shit!

20
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,788
Shit!

21
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,160
Open up!

22
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,996
I'm bleeding all over the hallway!

23
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,834
It's a life-or-death
situation out here!

24
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:20,253
Look, I know you're in
there. I just saw you go in.

25
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,506
Open up!

26
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,675
I'm looking...

27
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,512
Well, are you just gonna stand there?

28
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,981
Get me a glass of water, dummy.

29
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,484
Can I use this? Thanks.

30
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:38,521
My niece gave him to me.

31
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,524
I haven't even named him yet. God.

32
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,826
Do you know the pressure
of an ecstatic six-year-old?

33
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:47,830
I mean, I kill that thing,
and her whole world collapses.

34
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,617
I like what you did with the place.

35
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,702
Hmm.

36
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,705
Yeah, nice setup. Still
like mine better though.

37
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:12,388
Yo, let me know if you
want a top-shelf hookup.

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,974
Actually, now that I have you...

39
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:19,562
will you help me move
a dresser... Mr. Muscles?

40
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,565
Okay, come on. Just come on.

41
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:36,329
Man 'N' Van is getting way too legit.

42
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,747
They used to just be, like, drummers

43
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,248
with their mom's Honda Odysseys.

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,584
Now it's an actual company in Queens.

45
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:45,171
I mean, the guys are literally men in vans.

46
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,589
I'd buy morphine from you,

47
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:51,594
if you could also get me Suboxone.

48
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:55,598
Well, it's pretty much
impossible to get Suboxone.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,433
My supplier doesn't have it.

50
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,441
I saw this song live once. It was so rad.

51
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:08,027
Don't you just love hearing
your favorite songs in person,

52
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,530
like, half deaf from the speakers,

53
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:15,084
- everyone going nuts around you?
- No.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,122
Direct. I respect that.

55
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:22,959
I just hate concerts.

56
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,794
Lots of people.

57
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:33,970
- You don't like people, huh?
- Not most of them, no.

58
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:37,473
Okay.

59
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,976
Well, so by that rationale, if you were

60
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:42,311
to really like one person, it'd be, like,

61
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:47,116
considered an aberration or an abnormality

62
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:51,621
- or special, even.
- I guess.

63
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,824
Well, I aim for special,

64
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:58,077
so challenge accepted.

65
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,338
I wish we already knew each other.

66
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:13,509
Would make this feel less awkward.

67
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,677
- You really feel awkward right now?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,521
Well, then I wish we
knew each other too then.

69
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:31,694
Oh, yikes.

70
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:36,449
I, um, I'm late. Meeting
the girls for drinks.

71
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,701
Oh, um, I'm Shayla.

72
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,540
Elliot.

73
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,909
You know, I do know of
a guy who sells Suboxone.

74
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,466
He's supposed to be
a fucking psychopath,

75
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,801
but if you want, I can call him.

76
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:57,250
You might be worth a psychopath.

77
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:59,522
I don't know. Maybe.

78
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,308
Oh, and keep the fish, you filthy animal.

79
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:16,525
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

80
00:06:24,382 --> 00:06:27,150
Sorry I
haven't talked to you in a while.

81
00:06:27,185 --> 00:06:29,819
I mean, it's only been
a month, which I guess

82
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:33,389
in the grand scheme of
things isn't that long.

83
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,058
Isn't our life like a blip

84
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:39,729
in the cosmic calender or something?

85
00:06:39,781 --> 00:06:42,031
So that's Shayla.

86
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:43,866
A blip.

87
00:06:43,902 --> 00:06:45,485
Not even.

88
00:06:45,537 --> 00:06:47,904
Here one blip, gone the next.

89
00:06:47,906 --> 00:06:50,990
Makes me hate myself that
I've already gotten used to

90
00:06:51,042 --> 00:06:53,242
the idea of her not being here.

91
00:06:53,295 --> 00:06:55,244
In a year, I'll maybe think about her

92
00:06:55,297 --> 00:06:57,046
every once in a while.

93
00:06:57,082 --> 00:07:00,583
Then she'll become an
anecdote, a thing to say.

94
00:07:00,585 --> 00:07:03,252
"I knew a girl that died,"

95
00:07:03,254 --> 00:07:07,423
with the added bonus of,
"She died because of me."

96
00:07:07,475 --> 00:07:12,729
- Maybe I should hate myself.
- Here are the last two forms.

97
00:07:12,764 --> 00:07:14,397
She's getting rid of me,

98
00:07:14,432 --> 00:07:16,683
in case you're still
trying to figure that out.

99
00:07:16,735 --> 00:07:18,735
- Once I...
- Sign on the bottom.

100
00:07:23,274 --> 00:07:24,774
Then I'll deliver it to the court,

101
00:07:24,826 --> 00:07:26,192
and in two weeks' time, you'll receive

102
00:07:26,244 --> 00:07:28,945
an official release from the mandate.

103
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:30,613
That second form means
that we've been sitting

104
00:07:30,665 --> 00:07:33,533
- in this room for a year.
- Over 52 hours

105
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:35,952
of Krista's voice
bouncing around this room.

106
00:07:36,004 --> 00:07:39,622
She thinks she's a
wasted echo. Maybe she is.

107
00:07:39,674 --> 00:07:41,457
I wonder how much time I've spent

108
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,460
- not listening to her in here.
- I'm worried about you, Elliot.

109
00:07:44,512 --> 00:07:46,218
I really want you to keep coming here.

110
00:07:46,219 --> 00:07:47,463
We've got a lot more work to do.

111
00:07:47,465 --> 00:07:48,965
She wants more from me

112
00:07:48,967 --> 00:07:50,600
but she doesn't believe in me.

113
00:07:50,635 --> 00:07:53,136
I tried because I believe
some part inside of you

114
00:07:53,138 --> 00:07:57,440
- wants to do this right.
- You?

115
00:07:57,475 --> 00:07:59,809
Are you on her side?

116
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,467
You should clean your sockets.

117
00:08:36,848 --> 00:08:40,283
Sounds too good to be true, but I'll bite.

118
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:43,320
- What's the ask?
- Given my client has information

119
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:45,055
that could help your client's case,

120
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:48,725
we want the meeting restricted
to her, Colby, and myself,

121
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:53,030
- and we want it conducted off-record.
- Antara, come on.

122
00:08:53,711 --> 00:08:58,174
- My client won't accept your presence.
- Our client pays for ours.

123
00:08:58,175 --> 00:09:00,203
Then you're duty-bound to present him

124
00:09:00,255 --> 00:09:03,140
with any legitimate offer
of beneficial evidence.

125
00:09:03,175 --> 00:09:04,975
Of course.

126
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:09,679
Give us something truly
legitimate and beneficial.

127
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:12,349
You won't even tell us what
the hell your client has.

128
00:09:12,384 --> 00:09:15,385
Seth, we've been sitting on opposite sides

129
00:09:15,421 --> 00:09:17,587
of the negotiating table for two decades.

130
00:09:17,623 --> 00:09:19,489
I'm not some joker come out of the woodwork

131
00:09:19,525 --> 00:09:21,324
trying to scam Colby for millions.

132
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,527
I'm giving him the only
glimmer of hope he's had.

133
00:09:26,398 --> 00:09:29,866
We'll pass along your
offer. Thanks for your time.

134
00:09:47,086 --> 00:09:49,970
Lloyd said you wanted to see me.

135
00:09:54,476 --> 00:09:57,928
Look, I appreciate your
commitment to this job.

136
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:01,264
I really do.

137
00:10:01,266 --> 00:10:04,101
But I don't see how you've plowed through

138
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,688
these last few weeks, so I
want to offer you some time off.

139
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,440
- Just some time to...
- I don't need time off.

140
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:13,610
I'm good.

141
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,333
Uh... uh, one more thing.

142
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:23,759
Look,

143
00:10:25,757 --> 00:10:28,625
I'm so sorry she was taken away, Elliot,

144
00:10:28,627 --> 00:10:34,131
but don't let her death
close you off entirely.

145
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:35,799
Find someone you can be

146
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:40,604
your honest self with, okay?

147
00:10:40,639 --> 00:10:43,140
I remember when
I was a kid, I got into web design

148
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,975
by ripping off sites I liked.

149
00:10:44,977 --> 00:10:47,561
All you had to do was
view source on your browser

150
00:10:47,613 --> 00:10:49,980
and there it was, the code.

151
00:10:50,032 --> 00:10:53,400
You could copy-paste
it, modify it a little,

152
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:59,322
put your name on it, and
like that, it was your site.

153
00:10:59,374 --> 00:11:01,158
View source.

154
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:04,161
What if we had that for people?

155
00:11:04,213 --> 00:11:06,329
Would people really want to see?

156
00:11:09,334 --> 00:11:11,615

160

_

161
00:11:18,281 --> 00:11:22,145
Find someone to be your honest self with?

162
00:11:22,181 --> 00:11:23,597
Bullshit.

163
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:30,187
Really good advice. Thanks.

164
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:37,611
I quote, "The U.S.
contingent of the hacker group Fsociety

Dude, I've been trying.

How many times do you want me to hack him?

175
00:12:06,725 --> 00:12:09,142
Do you know how hard hacking a hacker is?

176
00:12:09,194 --> 00:12:13,396
- Cisco switches OSes, like, all the time.
- Darlene, we need one meeting.

00:12:13,448 --> 00:12:15,982
Yeah, well, I've been using Cisco's handle

178
00:12:16,034 --> 00:12:18,652
to send requests for the past month.

179
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:20,737
I got nothing.

180
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:23,156
He's slower than me, but not by much.

181
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:25,408
If we can talk to
whiterose directly...

182
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:28,078
Whiterose? Whiterose?

183
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:30,880
Really?

184
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:34,551
Okay, if the guy even exists,

185
00:12:34,586 --> 00:12:40,507
and that's a big if, no way
he's meeting you face-to-face.

186
00:12:40,559 --> 00:12:42,592
For all we know...

187
00:12:42,594 --> 00:12:44,678
this dude's whiterose.

188
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:47,731
Excuse me!

189
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:49,649
Are you whiterose?

190
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,905
A likely story.

191
00:12:55,941 --> 00:12:58,942
'Sides, the tape backups already shipped

192
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:01,194
to all the new Steel Mountain facilities,

193
00:13:01,246 --> 00:13:05,282
and we still haven't
found a way around that.

194
00:13:05,334 --> 00:13:10,787
- I got a plan in motion.
- And God's laughing.

195
00:13:31,073 --> 00:13:33,857
This
is all I have left of her.

196
00:13:39,565 --> 00:13:42,232
I will miss her.

197
00:13:50,793 --> 00:13:52,125
I need to wipe again.

198
00:14:15,601 --> 00:14:17,984
So if you scroll to the next page,

199
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:19,820
you'll see the summary of capital budgets

200
00:14:19,855 --> 00:14:23,714
- or purchasing and operations.
- We get it. The goddamn earning reports

201
00:14:23,715 --> 00:14:27,277
- are gonna look good come Monday.
- Our aim is to facilitate bill payment

202
00:14:27,329 --> 00:14:29,329
and heighten financial security,

203
00:14:29,364 --> 00:14:31,081
so that's an extra 2%.

204
00:14:31,116 --> 00:14:32,449
You know, if we hadn't
turned our profits around,

205
00:14:32,451 --> 00:14:34,618
- I was gonna leave.
- No way.

206
00:14:34,670 --> 00:14:36,586
Where? Don't tell me Apple.

207
00:14:36,622 --> 00:14:38,955
- Google.
- Don't buy it.

208
00:14:39,007 --> 00:14:40,757
I got a blow job from the hiring executive

209
00:14:40,793 --> 00:14:42,626
on the Googleplex volleyball court.

210
00:14:42,678 --> 00:14:44,294
Oh, she was hot.

211
00:14:44,346 --> 00:14:49,433
Had a Marissa Mayer thing going on too.

212
00:14:49,468 --> 00:14:51,351
Hot execs started as hot assistants

213
00:14:51,386 --> 00:14:52,803
who fucked their way to the top

214
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:54,771
twice as fast as the rest of us.

215
00:14:54,807 --> 00:14:56,973
You know something screwed up?

216
00:14:57,025 --> 00:14:59,476
I heard that, some
assistants, they're going gay

217
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:02,612
- to move up the ladder.
- I'll do you one better.

218
00:15:02,648 --> 00:15:04,197
There's a special handful

219
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:07,534
of pathetically desperate
execs going cock jockey.

220
00:15:07,569 --> 00:15:10,120
No. Oh, my God!

221
00:15:10,155 --> 00:15:12,823
Hey, Dwight, I meant to
ask. How are your children?

222
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,041
Hell if I know. Sent 'em off to Lawrence.

223
00:15:15,077 --> 00:15:16,793
I think Julia likes art.

224
00:15:16,829 --> 00:15:20,547
- Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.
- Lawrence?

225
00:15:20,582 --> 00:15:21,965
You'll never be able

226
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,134
to afford that tuition on unemployment.

227
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:27,170
- Sorry?
- You're fired!

228
00:15:45,607 --> 00:15:47,858
You two as well.

229
00:15:47,910 --> 00:15:50,861
I'm making sure you all receive
the minimum severance packages.

230
00:15:52,364 --> 00:15:55,832
Mr. Wellick, I don't understand.

231
00:15:55,868 --> 00:15:57,534
What did we do?

232
00:16:04,426 --> 00:16:08,879
Nothing.

233
00:16:08,881 --> 00:16:11,848
- After...
- You said you would update me.

234
00:16:11,884 --> 00:16:13,717
I needed to discuss our situation

235
00:16:13,719 --> 00:16:15,886
with the state's attorney.

236
00:16:15,938 --> 00:16:21,224
- Thanks for coming in, Roy.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:23,612 --> 00:16:27,230
I think you should have a seat.

238
00:16:31,987 --> 00:16:34,120
Colby's lawyers called 30 minutes ago.

239
00:16:34,156 --> 00:16:37,073
They wanted a promise of total
immunity before the meeting,

240
00:16:37,075 --> 00:16:39,626
which I obtained from the man you just met.

241
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:43,713
So, yes, Colby agreed...

242
00:16:43,749 --> 00:16:46,967
with a caveat.

243
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,136
I can't be in the room.
You have to go in alone.

244
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:59,763
Look, you made a ballsy move...

245
00:16:59,765 --> 00:17:02,232
but you doing what
you're about to do...

246
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:04,267
entering the home of a very powerful man

247
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:07,070
with a lot at stake and
asking him for something...

248
00:17:07,105 --> 00:17:10,991
that's always a dangerous proposition.

249
00:17:11,026 --> 00:17:14,611
So one last time...

250
00:17:14,663 --> 00:17:16,613
are you sure you want to do this?

251
00:17:32,798 --> 00:17:35,098
Shit, man.

252
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:36,683
Thought you was one of them high schoolers

253
00:17:36,718 --> 00:17:38,685
stole my mom's chaise lounge.

254
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,971
As heartbreaking as it is to hear that,

255
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,138
you're gonna have to put that off.

256
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,807
Getting everybody back together.

257
00:17:43,809 --> 00:17:45,308
- Come on.
- No, man, not this time.

258
00:17:45,310 --> 00:17:47,644
I'm out.

259
00:17:47,696 --> 00:17:49,696
You can't be out. We need you.

260
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:52,649
Look, man, I got a new set of
people depending on me, okay?

261
00:17:52,701 --> 00:17:54,484
Clients out the wazoo.

262
00:17:54,536 --> 00:17:56,202
So, you know, I mean, good luck,

263
00:17:56,238 --> 00:17:59,122
and tell the kids I said hi.

264
00:17:59,157 --> 00:18:03,326
- What is this? What are you doing here?
- Well, I figured out how to insert

265
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:06,496
THC's genetic information
code into yeast cells.

266
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:08,498
Tripled my earning speed.

267
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:11,501
Plants need weeks to
develop. Microbes need days.

268
00:18:11,553 --> 00:18:14,504
So, what, you got a Bath and Body Works

269
00:18:14,506 --> 00:18:20,175
- bottling facility in your backyard?
- Try it.

270
00:18:20,228 --> 00:18:22,646
The THC level is borderline in that blend,

271
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:26,016
and the lavender doesn't
mess with the high.

272
00:18:26,068 --> 00:18:28,018
You just smooth it on your skin.

273
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:31,187
So you're rejecting a revolution
in favor of aroma profiles?

274
00:18:31,239 --> 00:18:33,189
What a waste of potential.

275
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:35,358
Look, man, I know I got a good brain.

276
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:38,528
Besides...

277
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:41,865
what was our little
project in the end, anyway?

278
00:18:41,917 --> 00:18:45,502
Wasted shit, if you ask me.

279
00:18:45,537 --> 00:18:47,837
Well, now you're borderline pissing me off.

280
00:18:47,873 --> 00:18:52,208
Is that a fact?

281
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,877
And what exactly are you gonna do

282
00:18:53,929 --> 00:19:00,384
- if I decide to cross that border?
- Look at my face, Romero.

283
00:19:00,435 --> 00:19:02,719
You and I both know I'm crazy.

284
00:19:02,721 --> 00:19:04,387
Not the cute kind either.

285
00:19:04,389 --> 00:19:07,474
I'm talking crazy crazy!

286
00:19:11,396 --> 00:19:13,446
You lost touch.

287
00:19:13,482 --> 00:19:14,898
You forgot the feeling of spilling blood

288
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:18,234
on the battlefield by winning the fight.

289
00:19:18,236 --> 00:19:20,904
I didn't want to hurt you, Romero.

290
00:19:20,906 --> 00:19:22,872
I love you, man.

291
00:19:22,908 --> 00:19:24,908
I just wanted you to come
back to the arcade with me

292
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,411
so we could change the world together.

293
00:19:28,413 --> 00:19:32,749
I am clearly too crazy
for you to say no to.

294
00:19:32,801 --> 00:19:33,883
Bang!

295
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:45,428
- Look on your face is priceless!
- Goddamn lunatic.

296
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,263
You gave me your word
when we started this thing

297
00:19:47,315 --> 00:19:48,765
that you'd finish it.

298
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:51,901
I gave you my word what
I'd do if you didn't.

299
00:19:51,937 --> 00:19:53,653
See you back at the arcade.

300
00:20:10,849 --> 00:20:13,517
Good. I see the girl got you tea.

301
00:20:17,724 --> 00:20:19,473
Well, let's get started.

302
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:29,266
How much do you want?

303
00:20:31,571 --> 00:20:34,939
Write your number.

304
00:20:34,991 --> 00:20:37,608
You can ask me anything you want,

305
00:20:37,610 --> 00:20:39,910
but I promise you, at the end of the day,

306
00:20:39,946 --> 00:20:42,947
money will always be better
than what you're looking for.

307
00:20:46,419 --> 00:20:49,787
Mr. Colby, did you attend

308
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:53,290
the executive board meetings during 1993?

309
00:20:57,096 --> 00:20:59,964
Were you in the room
when the decision was made

310
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:02,049
to ignore the treatment of hazardous waste

311
00:21:02,101 --> 00:21:04,018
in Washington Township?

312
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,811
I have information which can help you...

313
00:21:13,863 --> 00:21:18,566
if you answer my question.

314
00:21:18,618 --> 00:21:22,653
I don't know what you're talking about.

315
00:21:22,705 --> 00:21:25,656
If you agree to testify
against the executives

316
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:30,161
who covered up the illegal
dumping of epoxy resin waste,

317
00:21:30,213 --> 00:21:32,163
I will testify that I
broke chain of custody

318
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:34,882
with the dat file central to your case.

319
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:42,506
You're that hot little thing

320
00:21:42,508 --> 00:21:44,091
that came by here a month ago.

321
00:21:44,143 --> 00:21:47,895
The girl from Allsafe.

322
00:21:50,650 --> 00:21:53,734
I remember, yeah.

323
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:03,194
Okay... I'm gonna answer your question.

324
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:06,113
But here's what I need from you first.

325
00:22:06,165 --> 00:22:09,450
So I'm gonna pull down my pants,

326
00:22:09,502 --> 00:22:12,536
and then I'm gonna need you to
take that pouty mouth of yours

327
00:22:12,588 --> 00:22:15,039
and swallow up my balls.

328
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:18,292
Now, they're big and hairy,
especially the left one,

329
00:22:18,344 --> 00:22:20,628
so you're really gonna
have to, I don't know,

330
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:24,014
squish 'em up to get 'em inside there.

331
00:22:24,050 --> 00:22:26,550
You're probably gonna have
to do one cheek at a time.

332
00:22:26,552 --> 00:22:31,138
But then, once they're
all warm and snug in there,

333
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:34,725
I want you to repeat your question to me

334
00:22:34,777 --> 00:22:37,978
as clearly as you can.

335
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:42,233
Then, and only then,
am I willing to answer.

336
00:22:46,405 --> 00:22:49,406
What do you say?

337
00:23:06,926 --> 00:23:11,061
If you don't take this deal...

338
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:14,932
you'll become like me.

339
00:23:14,984 --> 00:23:19,853
Sure, maybe you'll live in this house...

340
00:23:19,906 --> 00:23:22,106
maybe you'll have money,

341
00:23:22,158 --> 00:23:24,275
but even if your expensive
lawyers find a way

342
00:23:24,327 --> 00:23:29,113
to get you off, people will
still think that you're guilty.

343
00:23:35,454 --> 00:23:41,258
Losing everyone's respect...

344
00:23:43,462 --> 00:23:46,263
The respect of people you know

345
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:52,219
and the people you don't...

346
00:23:52,271 --> 00:23:57,141
it's a shitty feeling.

347
00:23:57,193 --> 00:23:59,977
Trust me.

348
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,161
I'll have "the girl" let me out.

349
00:24:24,003 --> 00:24:27,338
Flipper. Is she microchipped?

350
00:24:34,563 --> 00:24:38,182
Okay, very good.

351
00:24:38,234 --> 00:24:39,400
Housekeeping done.

352
00:24:39,401 --> 00:24:42,186
Now onto the real business.

353
00:24:42,595 --> 00:24:48,932
- Has your dog ever eaten trash before?
- No. I mean, not that I remember.

354
00:24:48,933 --> 00:24:51,161
Well, lucky for your bank account,

355
00:24:51,197 --> 00:24:53,364
the piece is small
enough to pass on its own.

356
00:24:53,416 --> 00:24:55,366
Unfortunately, though, it's large enough

357
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:57,368
to send her puking all over your apartment.

358
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:01,372
So I would crate her for
a few days and monitor her.

359
00:25:01,424 --> 00:25:04,092
She won't know what you're
doing is good for her.

360
00:25:18,274 --> 00:25:19,690
What the hell did you do?

361
00:25:19,725 --> 00:25:22,226
You were right. I was
only trying to prove...

362
00:25:22,228 --> 00:25:24,778
Colby's lawyers
just called. He wants to talk.

363
00:25:25,699 --> 00:25:28,400
Get back there.

364
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:41,745
It's a little early in the
morning to be nerding out,

365
00:25:41,797 --> 00:25:46,129
- don't you think?
- How long?

366
00:25:52,725 --> 00:25:54,224
- Hmm?
- I knew if I asked you that...

367
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:58,755
- How long?
- Couple weeks.

368
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,269
And you had the balls to ask
for whiterose with my shit?

369
00:26:05,271 --> 00:26:08,272
It's like you want to get us both killed.

370
00:26:08,324 --> 00:26:11,161
What happened? He responded?

371
00:26:12,778 --> 00:26:16,413
You know, you didn't have to make me look

372
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:17,865
like a shitty foot soldier.

373
00:26:17,917 --> 00:26:21,705
- Nobody would ever even know...
- You got root on my box and found the IP,

374
00:26:21,706 --> 00:26:25,506
then you joined their
channel with my handle.

375
00:26:30,346 --> 00:26:34,465
We're so done.

376
00:26:34,467 --> 00:26:36,133
I don't want to see you again.

377
00:26:42,608 --> 00:26:44,942
But you fools actually got your wish.

378
00:26:46,645 --> 00:26:47,529
I don't know why,

379
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,982
but the meeting's actually gonna be on.

380
00:26:49,682 --> 00:26:51,982
I'd tell you to be careful, but I know

381
00:26:51,984 --> 00:26:53,884
that's the last thing you're gonna be.

382
00:27:09,781 --> 00:27:14,535
My lawyers are looking over the paperwork.

383
00:27:14,587 --> 00:27:18,005
- Does that mean that...
- Exactly what I said.

384
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,207
I asked you back here to make
sure that you can pull off

385
00:27:20,259 --> 00:27:22,876
your testimony, make sure that this

386
00:27:22,928 --> 00:27:24,511
chain of custody story
of yours is straight.

387
00:27:24,547 --> 00:27:30,217
- I can't afford any trips.
- I'm not going to trip.

388
00:27:33,556 --> 00:27:35,806
So, what...

389
00:27:35,858 --> 00:27:37,474
what's in this for you, anyway?

390
00:27:37,526 --> 00:27:40,477
I know you hate me.

391
00:27:40,479 --> 00:27:42,896
So, what, you're gonna
just let me off Scot-free?

392
00:27:42,948 --> 00:27:49,641
- What do you get out of this?
- Earlier, I asked you a question.

393
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,991
You never answered it.

394
00:27:53,993 --> 00:27:59,379
If I'm agreeing to testify
in your case, then, yes,

395
00:27:59,415 --> 00:28:01,832
you know, I attended several meetings.

396
00:28:01,834 --> 00:28:07,004
Tell me about the one when
they decided to ignore the leak.

397
00:28:07,006 --> 00:28:09,339
I'm not sure what you're asking.

398
00:28:09,341 --> 00:28:13,060
What was the meeting like
when you decided this?

399
00:28:15,598 --> 00:28:18,182
I get it.

400
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:20,934
You want to know, like, what was it like?

401
00:28:20,986 --> 00:28:25,189
Like, um, did we all have
cigars and laugh hysterically

402
00:28:25,241 --> 00:28:27,241
as we signed the evil documents?

403
00:28:27,276 --> 00:28:29,026
Is that what you pictured?

404
00:28:29,078 --> 00:28:30,410
Well, I'm sorry, hon.

405
00:28:30,446 --> 00:28:33,080
See, the world doesn't work like that.

406
00:28:33,115 --> 00:28:37,251
Tell me. Tell me how it works.

407
00:28:40,456 --> 00:28:44,041
Uh, Jesus, um... all right, all right.

408
00:28:44,043 --> 00:28:49,096
Let's see. January, '93.

409
00:28:49,131 --> 00:28:51,765
Well, my secretary then was Elaine.

410
00:28:51,801 --> 00:28:54,268
So Elaine brought us a
platter of shrimp cocktail

411
00:28:54,303 --> 00:28:58,388
to tide us to dinner, which pissed us off

412
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:01,775
because we just had a
platter at the holiday party.

413
00:29:01,811 --> 00:29:03,227
Jim opened the bar.

414
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,729
Now Jim was a real piece of work.

415
00:29:05,731 --> 00:29:07,981
I mean, half pansy, half mafia.

416
00:29:08,033 --> 00:29:11,485
First sign of a tight
decision, he'd be chain smoking

417
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:14,404
down a river of scotch.

418
00:29:14,406 --> 00:29:17,741
Uh...

419
00:29:17,793 --> 00:29:19,576
you know, it rained.

420
00:29:19,578 --> 00:29:22,546
It rained. I remember that, yeah.

421
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:28,969
So...

422
00:29:29,004 --> 00:29:34,591
you were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail,

423
00:29:34,643 --> 00:29:38,312
and it was raining when you
decided my mother would die?

424
00:29:46,272 --> 00:29:49,439
That's why.

425
00:29:49,441 --> 00:29:53,193
So people like you won't keep
sitting in rooms together.

426
00:30:00,786 --> 00:30:05,622
Did any of it ever give you or anyone pause

427
00:30:05,624 --> 00:30:12,480
- when you made those decisions?
- Yeah.

428
00:30:14,183 --> 00:30:16,300
Yeah, sure.

429
00:30:19,221 --> 00:30:23,473
But, um...

430
00:30:23,475 --> 00:30:27,861
then you go home, and,
uh, and you have dinner,

431
00:30:27,897 --> 00:30:32,532
you know, and you
wake up the next morning.

432
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,994
Here's to a man who has a
bright future at our company,

433
00:30:43,996 --> 00:30:46,413
a man you all know,

434
00:30:46,465 --> 00:30:49,917
a man who is going to change
this company for the good,

435
00:30:49,969 --> 00:30:55,005
a man smart enough to marry
a woman every bit his equal...

436
00:30:56,759 --> 00:31:01,678
Our new Chief Technology
Officer, Scott Knowles.

437
00:31:01,730 --> 00:31:04,821
- Here, here!
- Thank you. Thank you.

438
00:31:05,234 --> 00:31:06,516
- Thank you, Phillip.
- Welcome.

439
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,185
- Thank you very much.
- Here we go.

440
00:31:08,187 --> 00:31:09,736
- It's great to be here.
- And we're off.

441
00:31:09,772 --> 00:31:11,438
- Thanks, Phillip.
- You're very welcome.

442
00:31:11,490 --> 00:31:13,774
- Congratulations, darling.
- Thank you, thank you.

443
00:31:13,826 --> 00:31:16,276
- I'll leave you to it, okay?
- Don't break a sweat.

444
00:31:16,328 --> 00:31:18,445
- Oh, here, come, say hello.
- Hey, Joe, how are you?

445
00:31:22,418 --> 00:31:24,418
_

446
00:31:39,184 --> 00:31:41,601
Thank you.

447
00:31:46,642 --> 00:31:50,394
- Tyrell, nice to see you.
- Is it?

448
00:31:50,396 --> 00:31:52,562
I hear you shared our
moment with your husband.

449
00:31:52,564 --> 00:31:54,398
Oh, come on.

450
00:31:54,450 --> 00:31:56,116
That was over a month ago.

451
00:31:56,151 --> 00:31:58,902
Don't tell me you're still sore.

452
00:31:58,954 --> 00:32:01,989
Hmm, I sense some defeat.

453
00:32:09,331 --> 00:32:14,418
Well, I considered myself, at
the very least, reprimanded.

454
00:32:14,420 --> 00:32:16,136
How disappointing.

455
00:32:16,171 --> 00:32:18,755
One tiny curveball and you gave up.

456
00:32:18,807 --> 00:32:22,009
- Miss.
- Thank you.

457
00:32:22,061 --> 00:32:23,593
Should have known that
you were nothing more

458
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:26,146
than a bold entrance.

459
00:32:26,181 --> 00:32:28,682
Are you saying you don't
crave a bold entrance

460
00:32:28,734 --> 00:32:33,153
every time, over and over, sustained?

461
00:32:33,188 --> 00:32:36,940
- Meet me tonight.
- I'm a little busy.

462
00:32:36,942 --> 00:32:39,993
- Come to my office now.
- Are you really asking me that?

463
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:43,113
I don't recall phrasing
it as a question, no.

464
00:32:43,165 --> 00:32:46,333
Fine, then I just won't show up.

465
00:32:46,368 --> 00:32:48,368
Then the roof.

466
00:32:48,420 --> 00:32:50,837
Take the back stairwell.

467
00:32:50,873 --> 00:32:53,123
The cameras have been out since March.

468
00:32:53,125 --> 00:32:56,209
No one will know.

469
00:33:01,216 --> 00:33:02,883
Well, you just made a long day longer.

470
00:33:02,935 --> 00:33:04,718
I know that Allsafe will have to fire me,

471
00:33:04,770 --> 00:33:06,553
but testifying was the right thing to do.

472
00:33:06,605 --> 00:33:09,222
I have worked my ass
off to take care of you

473
00:33:09,274 --> 00:33:11,024
and of every person in this company.

474
00:33:11,060 --> 00:33:15,047
- Do you know what that means?
- You've been a great boss, Gideon...

475
00:33:15,048 --> 00:33:18,148
See, once this confession goes public,

476
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,150
no one will want to do business with us.

477
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:21,735
The company will go under.

478
00:33:21,787 --> 00:33:23,203
I couldn't let Colby take the fall

479
00:33:23,238 --> 00:33:24,988
- for something that I did.
- Oh, come on!

480
00:33:24,990 --> 00:33:26,656
You and I both know you
didn't break chain of custody.

481
00:33:26,658 --> 00:33:32,796
- I did and I feel terrible...
- Angela! Please! Stop lying.

482
00:33:36,301 --> 00:33:41,588
You do this... all these people go down,

483
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:44,674
all their families that rely

484
00:33:44,726 --> 00:33:48,228
on what this company provides for them.

485
00:34:10,002 --> 00:34:14,254
So this is where the rabbit hole leads?

486
00:34:14,289 --> 00:34:15,422
Got to be honest,

487
00:34:15,457 --> 00:34:18,458
I half-expected you not to show up.

488
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:22,379
And I half-expected
you to be a tattletale.

489
00:34:22,431 --> 00:34:24,297
So you are sore.

490
00:34:24,349 --> 00:34:26,800
Oh, come on. You intrigued me.

491
00:34:26,852 --> 00:34:29,386
I intrigued back.

492
00:34:29,438 --> 00:34:34,283
- Can't we just be more straightforward?
- Oh, that's no fun, but if you insist,

493
00:34:34,939 --> 00:34:37,310
I just came up here to
see if you were really

494
00:34:37,362 --> 00:34:40,397
as gullible as you seem.

495
00:34:40,449 --> 00:34:42,899
My husband's downstairs
getting the job that you want,

496
00:34:42,951 --> 00:34:44,901
and you're up here trying to fuck me.

497
00:34:44,953 --> 00:34:47,404
Now whether that's you
being straightforward

498
00:34:47,406 --> 00:34:49,623
or a game, either way,

499
00:34:49,658 --> 00:34:54,911
- it's played pretty poorly, if you ask me.
- Hmm. Again, I asked no question.

500
00:34:54,913 --> 00:34:56,913
All I can tell you is you need this

501
00:34:56,965 --> 00:34:59,299
'cause you're dissatisfied.

502
00:34:59,334 --> 00:35:02,085
Scott plans on firing you,

503
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:06,089
and you are clinging on
to any chance you can get.

504
00:35:06,141 --> 00:35:09,593
You seem desperate.

505
00:35:57,109 --> 00:35:59,142
Hey... hey!

506
00:35:59,194 --> 00:36:01,645
What do you... get off of me!

507
00:36:01,697 --> 00:36:04,197
Stop!

508
00:38:02,295 --> 00:38:04,379
We connected with whiterose.

509
00:38:04,414 --> 00:38:06,414
The plan is back on.

510
00:38:08,752 --> 00:38:13,087
I could bullshit you, tell
you you're the only person

511
00:38:13,139 --> 00:38:17,592
who can fill the exact
void we have at Fsociety.

512
00:38:17,644 --> 00:38:19,677
The truth is, I need
this group back together.

513
00:38:25,101 --> 00:38:26,434
Have you ever considered which part

514
00:38:26,486 --> 00:38:29,437
of our scheme motivates you?

515
00:38:29,439 --> 00:38:31,322
When the Dark Army bailed, you didn't care

516
00:38:31,358 --> 00:38:34,409
if pushing a button would
bring an economic revolution.

517
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:37,612
You want momentary anarchy.

518
00:38:37,614 --> 00:38:39,280
The others?

519
00:38:39,282 --> 00:38:41,115
Mobley likes palling around.

520
00:38:41,167 --> 00:38:43,785
Romero wants a whiff of fame.

521
00:38:43,837 --> 00:38:46,504
Those reasons depress me.

522
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:54,512
- What's the part you want?
- You don't care.

523
00:39:01,888 --> 00:39:04,138
My parents were born in Iran.

524
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:06,274
They came here like everybody else,

525
00:39:06,309 --> 00:39:07,475
for freedom,

526
00:39:07,527 --> 00:39:09,644
but my dad works 60-hour weeks

527
00:39:09,646 --> 00:39:13,531
to determine tax loopholes
for a millionaire art dealer.

528
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:16,451
My mom, she ran up loans into five digits

529
00:39:16,486 --> 00:39:19,320
to get an online degree.

530
00:39:19,372 --> 00:39:22,990
They won't shut up about
how great America is.

531
00:39:23,043 --> 00:39:25,793
But they're gonna die in debt doing things

532
00:39:25,829 --> 00:39:27,912
they never wanted to do.

533
00:39:35,004 --> 00:39:36,795
There are how many billion

534
00:39:36,796 --> 00:39:40,308
- people in this world?
- 7.3.

535
00:39:40,343 --> 00:39:44,312
Somehow you and I landed together...

536
00:39:44,347 --> 00:39:47,065
doing something impossible
if we were alone,

537
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:49,567
not to mention at the
right point in history

538
00:39:49,602 --> 00:39:51,986
with the right resources.

539
00:39:52,021 --> 00:39:53,688
We have what we've worked for

540
00:39:53,690 --> 00:39:56,240
right there for the taking.

541
00:39:56,276 --> 00:39:58,910
We just need each other
to see this through.

542
00:40:13,927 --> 00:40:16,627
You come any closer, I'm calling the cops.

543
00:40:21,718 --> 00:40:25,720
Hi, operator. I'd like
to report an emergency.

544
00:40:25,772 --> 00:40:28,389
I placed a malicious
CD in my work computer,

545
00:40:28,391 --> 00:40:31,859
and now this guy at the
gym is saying hi to me.

546
00:40:31,895 --> 00:40:34,499
- I'm going home.
- I need you to do something for me.

547
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:37,031
Call the girl who wants
to be involved, okay?

548
00:40:37,066 --> 00:40:38,449
Her name is Angela Moss.

549
00:40:38,485 --> 00:40:40,334
- Let me give you her phone number.
- Listen, pussy.

550
00:40:40,335 --> 00:40:41,953
If you don't do what I say,

551
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:44,405
then the giant shit storm
that rains turds later

552
00:40:44,457 --> 00:40:48,409
will leave a trail of clouds in
the sky spelling out your name.

553
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:57,822
Elliot?

554
00:40:59,266 --> 00:41:03,715
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I'm here for my appointment.

555
00:41:06,262 --> 00:41:08,930
Well, you can slip in
before my first patient.

556
00:41:29,209 --> 00:41:33,338
- You told me I should tell you the truth.
- Yes.

557
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:40,461
Everything I say will still
be protected and confidential?

558
00:41:46,219 --> 00:41:50,638
I've been lying to you.

559
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:53,357
I don't take my pills.

560
00:41:53,393 --> 00:41:56,811
But you don't either.

561
00:41:56,813 --> 00:41:58,696
Your refill frequency
for Ativan doesn't match

562
00:41:58,731 --> 00:42:00,948
your prescription divided by the dosage.

563
00:42:06,406 --> 00:42:09,874
This morning...

564
00:42:09,909 --> 00:42:12,660
you bought a tall hazelnut latte.

565
00:42:12,712 --> 00:42:15,546
Paid for it on your Evil Corp card.

566
00:42:15,582 --> 00:42:18,499
By text, you justified the
indulgence to your sister

567
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:20,668
because Evil Corp gives you double rewards.

568
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,505
But those points only
accumulate on travel expenses.

569
00:42:24,507 --> 00:42:27,174
You're not good with money.

570
00:42:27,227 --> 00:42:31,646
On paper, your Thursday
2:00, Marilyn O'Brien,

571
00:42:31,681 --> 00:42:34,348
is your doppelganger.

572
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,568
I think you're encouraging her

573
00:42:37,604 --> 00:42:41,822
to leave her husband...

574
00:42:41,858 --> 00:42:43,858
because you're tired of being dumped.

575
00:42:47,747 --> 00:42:49,530
You like porn, especially anal.

576
00:42:49,582 --> 00:42:51,198
Whether you like it yourself, I don't know.

577
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,584
That's not relevant to me.

578
00:42:53,620 --> 00:42:55,703
You've told your best friend Jennifer

579
00:42:55,705 --> 00:43:01,542
that you wish your mom would die.

580
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:04,929
I sometimes watch you on your webcam.

581
00:43:04,964 --> 00:43:09,216
You cry sometimes...

582
00:43:09,269 --> 00:43:13,721
just like me.

583
00:43:13,773 --> 00:43:16,390
Because you're lonely.

584
00:43:22,282 --> 00:43:24,198
I don't just hack you, Krista.

585
00:43:24,233 --> 00:43:26,784
I hack everyone...

586
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:29,954
my friends, coworkers.

587
00:43:35,411 --> 00:43:38,462
But I've helped a lot of people.

588
00:43:44,003 --> 00:43:48,255
I want...

589
00:43:48,308 --> 00:43:53,311
a way out of loneliness...

590
00:43:53,346 --> 00:43:55,896
just like you.

591
00:44:07,276 --> 00:44:10,661
Is that what you wanted to hear?
