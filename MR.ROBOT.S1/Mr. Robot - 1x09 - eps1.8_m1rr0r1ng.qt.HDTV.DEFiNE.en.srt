1
00:00:00,463 --> 00:00:02,715
<i>Exciting time
in the world right now.</i>

2
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:05,343
- Exciting time.
- If you agree to testify,

3
00:00:05,368 --> 00:00:07,411
I will testify that I
broke chain of custody

4
00:00:07,436 --> 00:00:08,602
with the .DAT file.

5
00:00:08,627 --> 00:00:11,127
We've implemented a honey pot, CS30.

6
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:12,796
I'd like to look over your findings,

7
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:14,798
especially this server.

8
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:16,883
<i>Detectives came by. They
want to speak with you.</i>

9
00:00:16,935 --> 00:00:18,552
<i>They found a body on the roof.</i>

10
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:20,437
And you both did know the deceased.

11
00:00:20,472 --> 00:00:21,929
<i>Sharon Knowles.</i>

12
00:00:21,954 --> 00:00:23,189
Sharon Knowles?

13
00:00:23,214 --> 00:00:24,968
- <i> Aah!</i>
- I think the baby's coming.

14
00:00:24,993 --> 00:00:26,321
We got to get her to the hospital.

15
00:00:26,346 --> 00:00:28,012
Tell me about your father.

16
00:00:28,046 --> 00:00:30,464
I remember I tried to hug
him, tell him I'm sorry,

17
00:00:30,516 --> 00:00:34,243
and he shoved me so hard, I
fell backwards out the window.

18
00:00:35,063 --> 00:00:36,697
Oh, my God, Elliot!

19
00:00:36,722 --> 00:00:39,331
Did you forget again?
Did you forget who I am?

20
00:00:39,356 --> 00:00:41,650
- <i>I'm your... </i>
- Sister.

21
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:49,171
I think we should talk.

22
00:00:52,337 --> 00:00:54,404
<i>It hasn't happened since 1904,</i>

23
00:00:54,439 --> 00:00:57,017
<i>the year John McGraw decided
to take his bat and ball</i>

24
00:00:57,042 --> 00:00:59,375
<i>and go home. Here we
are 90 years later,</i>

25
00:00:59,428 --> 00:01:01,344
<i>and I want to get your
thoughts on what it was like</i>

26
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:04,216
<i>to be without the 1994 World Series.</i>

27
00:01:04,241 --> 00:01:07,375
<i>That's right, the 1994
World Series cancelled... </i>

28
00:01:07,436 --> 00:01:09,050
<i> If you would have told me</i>

29
00:01:09,075 --> 00:01:10,854
<i>back in August when the
players voted to walk out</i>

30
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:12,866
<i>that we would be here
where we are today,</i>

31
00:01:12,891 --> 00:01:14,357
<i>I would have told
you no way, no how,</i>

32
00:01:14,392 --> 00:01:16,392
<i>that's not gonna happen.</i>

33
00:01:16,394 --> 00:01:18,144
<i>But hey, if I ever get
it wrong, I admit it.</i>

34
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:20,730
<i>So, what happened? I
want to hear from you... </i>

35
00:01:20,755 --> 00:01:23,609
Mr. Robot.

36
00:01:24,292 --> 00:01:26,763
Um, well, I'd recommend the Pentium 90.

37
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,322
They're lighting fast, and
we've got some in stock now.

38
00:01:29,347 --> 00:01:33,466
With an 800 megabyte hard
drive, you'll be all set.

39
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,157
Or we could save you a few bucks

40
00:01:35,182 --> 00:01:36,648
and upgrade what you have.

41
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,191
Once we swap out that motherboard

42
00:01:38,216 --> 00:01:41,218
and hard drive, you'll be better than new.

43
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:44,554
Why don't you bring it on
by, and we'll take a look.

44
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:45,662
Okay.

45
00:01:45,691 --> 00:01:46,773
Thank you.

46
00:01:46,808 --> 00:01:48,642
Bye-bye.

47
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:51,204
What happened? That new
mouse not work out for you?

48
00:01:51,229 --> 00:01:54,397
Your son, he stole money from me.

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,982
Uh, excuse me?

50
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:58,177
Your son stole money from
me. I pulled out my wallet,

51
00:01:58,202 --> 00:02:00,487
and I specifically
remembered I had three 20s.

52
00:02:00,512 --> 00:02:01,878
Now I only have one.

53
00:02:01,907 --> 00:02:03,540
<i>I used one to pay for the mouse,</i>

54
00:02:03,575 --> 00:02:04,824
<i>and then I had two left.</i>

55
00:02:04,876 --> 00:02:07,544
Your son was standing right behind me

56
00:02:07,579 --> 00:02:09,579
when I had my money out on the counter.

57
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:11,164
I... just calm down.

58
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,763
I'm sure there's an explanation for this.

59
00:02:12,788 --> 00:02:14,084
<i>I don't want an explanation.</i>

60
00:02:14,109 --> 00:02:15,892
The only thing I want from you is my money

61
00:02:15,917 --> 00:02:18,284
and a [bleep] apology.

62
00:02:18,309 --> 00:02:19,508
There's no need for that.

63
00:02:19,533 --> 00:02:21,116
I'm just trying to figure it out.

64
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,892
Can you tell how much of
a shit I give about that?

65
00:02:23,917 --> 00:02:26,368
Ugh. I don't have time for this.

66
00:02:26,565 --> 00:02:29,599
Are you giving me my money or not?

67
00:02:29,651 --> 00:02:32,485
<i>Look, do the right thing here, guy.</i>

68
00:02:36,644 --> 00:02:38,977
Then, no.

69
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,659
Excuse me?

70
00:02:40,684 --> 00:02:43,018
The answer's no.

71
00:02:47,864 --> 00:02:50,448
Are you... you being serious right now?

72
00:02:50,473 --> 00:02:53,724
I can't help you.

73
00:02:53,792 --> 00:02:58,762
You... you're really just
gonna sit there and lie?

74
00:02:58,797 --> 00:03:01,265
<i>I should call the cops!</i>

75
00:03:03,115 --> 00:03:05,115
What an example you're setting.

76
00:03:05,437 --> 00:03:06,803
I... I earn my money,

77
00:03:06,855 --> 00:03:10,106
and you're just teaching him how to steal.

78
00:03:10,142 --> 00:03:11,558
You're a terrible father.

79
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:13,143
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

80
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,728
<i>You're a nobody.</i>

81
00:03:14,780 --> 00:03:16,949
You're a middle-aged man doing

82
00:03:16,974 --> 00:03:20,725
what my retarded nephew could do.

83
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:24,284
<i>That's your life.</i>

84
00:03:24,309 --> 00:03:27,343
You know what? Keep your 20.

85
00:03:27,368 --> 00:03:29,702
I'll just go to Best Buy from now on.

86
00:03:29,727 --> 00:03:32,076
God...

87
00:03:48,286 --> 00:03:50,787
Come on out.

88
00:04:02,861 --> 00:04:05,862
Dad, I didn't do it.

89
00:04:13,703 --> 00:04:15,336
Let me see it.

90
00:04:40,307 --> 00:04:42,307
"Timecop" or "Stargate"?

91
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,536
What? 20 bucks ought
to cover the both of us.

92
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,084
"Pulp Fiction"? Never heard of it.

93
00:04:58,198 --> 00:05:00,281
Sure I can take you to that?

94
00:05:00,306 --> 00:05:01,973
<i>All right, get your jacket.</i>

95
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:28,227
What?

96
00:05:30,145 --> 00:05:32,929
How come I'm not in trouble?

97
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:40,201
Even though what you did was wrong,

98
00:05:40,226 --> 00:05:44,345
you're still a good kid,

99
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,236
and that guy was a prick.

100
00:05:46,261 --> 00:05:50,847
Sometimes that matters more.

101
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:53,079
Come on, let's go. It starts in 15 minutes.

102
00:05:53,104 --> 00:05:54,987
I want to get some popcorn. Come on.

103

104
00:06:42,854 --> 00:06:45,521
It's really him.

105
00:06:52,303 --> 00:06:54,854
It's really you.

106
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:04,405
Never been to your apartment before.

107
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:06,681
It's nice.

108
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:12,025
A little messy, but that's
not Earth-shattering news.

109
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:14,884
You never really did
like cleaning your room.

110
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:22,782
Jesus [bleep] Christ.

111
00:07:24,868 --> 00:07:27,952
I can't believe it's really you.

112
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,649
I was beginning to wonder how long

113
00:07:29,701 --> 00:07:32,485
it was gonna take before you recognized me.

114
00:07:32,537 --> 00:07:38,241
The fact that you stopped
recognizing Darlene too, well...

115
00:07:38,293 --> 00:07:41,794
I got to be honest, that's
a little disconcerting.

116
00:07:44,716 --> 00:07:46,883
Why didn't you say anything?

117
00:07:46,908 --> 00:07:48,652
- Why didn't you tell me?
- Okay, Elliot...

118
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:49,896
This whole time?

119
00:07:49,921 --> 00:07:52,422
Elliot, you are not well.

120
00:07:52,447 --> 00:07:57,233
I was trying to handle it gently.

121
00:07:57,262 --> 00:07:59,357
Gently?

122
00:07:59,382 --> 00:08:01,299
Gently?

123
00:08:01,324 --> 00:08:04,025
Gently?

124
00:08:04,269 --> 00:08:07,103
Is that what the last
three months have been?

125
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,608
No. It's been about us
doing something important,

126
00:08:12,661 --> 00:08:16,412
and that's what it still needs to be about.

127
00:08:16,448 --> 00:08:18,498
You died.

128
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:21,417
You died.

129
00:08:21,453 --> 00:08:23,252
You're dead!

130
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:28,051
I suggest you lower your voice.

131
00:08:32,127 --> 00:08:34,074
Lower my voice?

132
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,600
You want me to lower my voice
after appearing at my door

133
00:08:37,635 --> 00:08:41,804
20 years after your supposed death?

134
00:08:43,573 --> 00:08:49,846
I think this is a perfect [bleep] volume!

135
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:57,670
Elliot, you don't want them to hear us.

136
00:08:57,695 --> 00:09:00,106
Especially after my impromptu visit from

137
00:09:00,131 --> 00:09:02,298
Tyrell Wellick last night.

138
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:09,029
<i>Elliot, there are people out there</i>

139
00:09:09,054 --> 00:09:11,886
<i>who do not want us to work together.</i>

140
00:09:14,839 --> 00:09:18,591
Is that why they've been following me?

141
00:09:18,643 --> 00:09:22,812
Is that why, because of you?

142
00:09:22,847 --> 00:09:25,932
Think about it. You don't remember me.

143
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:28,017
You don't remember your
own God damn sister.

144
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,521
<i>You see that shrink,
pop their pills.</i>

145
00:09:31,573 --> 00:09:33,606
They intentionally put
you in this haze, fog,

146
00:09:33,658 --> 00:09:35,775
or whatever brain matter
you have left in there,

147
00:09:35,827 --> 00:09:38,828
so you forget what they want you to forget.

148
00:09:38,863 --> 00:09:40,947
<i>They're trying to
control you, Elliot.</i>

149
00:09:40,999 --> 00:09:43,833
<i>They've been trying to
control you all along.</i>

150
00:09:43,868 --> 00:09:47,036
This is crazy. I'm crazy.

151
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:48,463
I'm crazy. You're crazy.

152
00:09:48,488 --> 00:09:49,516
This is crazy.

153
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,457
What are you talking about?

154
00:09:51,509 --> 00:09:53,459
<i>Who's trying to control me?</i>

155
00:09:53,511 --> 00:09:56,712
The people out there
who don't want me alive.

156
00:09:56,765 --> 00:09:59,849
The people who are afraid of us.

157
00:09:59,884 --> 00:10:03,352
We have to be more
careful, now more than ever.

158
00:10:03,388 --> 00:10:08,558
And Darlene, she knew about this?

159
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,561
Elliot, I will explain everything,

160
00:10:11,586 --> 00:10:16,255
but right now, tonight, we
have to stick to the plan.

161
00:10:16,284 --> 00:10:18,067
Are you kidding me?

162
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,570
You want me to put this on hold?

163
00:10:20,622 --> 00:10:22,905
Are you out of your God damn mind?

164
00:10:22,930 --> 00:10:25,181
It's not safe to discuss this here.

165
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:29,245
I don't give a shit!

166
00:10:29,297 --> 00:10:31,747
Tell me what the [bleep] is going on.

167
00:10:35,086 --> 00:10:38,588
All right. Come on, let's go.

168
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,922
Where?

169
00:10:42,977 --> 00:10:45,011
You want answers?

170
00:10:45,063 --> 00:10:47,563
Stop asking questions and follow me.

171
00:10:59,513 --> 00:11:01,547
Oh, that's sweet. I... I can't.

172
00:11:01,599 --> 00:11:03,132
You're going too fast.

173
00:11:03,144 --> 00:11:05,445
Trust me, don't think that's the problem.

174
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,603
Hey.

175
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:09,996
I know you didn't want to talk last night.

176
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,118
No, Harry, I can't right now.

177
00:11:12,143 --> 00:11:13,893
- I have to...
- Breathe...

178
00:11:13,945 --> 00:11:15,445
and have some breakfast in bed with me.

179
00:11:30,709 --> 00:11:33,160
How are you enjoying anything like that?

180
00:11:35,410 --> 00:11:36,526
Mm.

181
00:11:36,668 --> 00:11:38,017
Honey, I appreciate it.

182
00:11:38,042 --> 00:11:41,564
I... God, if you only knew.

183
00:11:41,589 --> 00:11:43,172
Tell me. I would love to know.

184
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:44,443
They hacked us. You know that.

185
00:11:44,468 --> 00:11:46,261
It's all over the news.

186
00:11:46,643 --> 00:11:48,521
Now, normally a company
can get through this,

187
00:11:48,546 --> 00:11:51,213
but we're a cyber security company.

188
00:11:51,265 --> 00:11:54,732
Can you appreciate how bad that is?

189
00:11:54,757 --> 00:11:58,959
We're hanging on by our fingernails.

190
00:11:59,182 --> 00:12:01,388
Ugh, who knows?

191
00:12:02,307 --> 00:12:04,754
Maybe we've already fallen off a cliff,

192
00:12:04,779 --> 00:12:07,644
and I'm still trying to
grasp on to something.

193
00:12:12,848 --> 00:12:16,216
I'm a failure.

194
00:12:16,241 --> 00:12:18,444
Look at me.

195
00:12:22,814 --> 00:12:25,815
Look at this person who loves you so much

196
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,673
he would die a happy
man right now just 'cause

197
00:12:27,702 --> 00:12:33,990
he had this, us, sitting
down and having breakfast.

198
00:12:34,015 --> 00:12:37,573
I don't think failing looks like this.

199
00:12:50,397 --> 00:12:52,522
Make sure you go through
all those emails again,

200
00:12:52,547 --> 00:12:54,120
everything from '91 to '95,

201
00:12:54,145 --> 00:12:55,611
and let's start building a table

202
00:12:55,646 --> 00:12:57,479
that cross-references our calendar.

203
00:12:57,481 --> 00:13:00,922
- Yes, ma'am.
- Hey, good to see you.

204
00:13:00,947 --> 00:13:02,785
Oh, you should be proud.

205
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,813
News of Colby's confession
is breaking today.

206
00:13:04,946 --> 00:13:09,392
So far we are firing on
all cylinders, so what's up?

207
00:13:09,427 --> 00:13:12,094
I came to help out.

208
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:19,329
Yeah, can you rescan these
and email the .PDFs to me

209
00:13:19,354 --> 00:13:20,548
and copy Ry on them?

210
00:13:20,573 --> 00:13:22,138
Shouldn't you be at work?

211
00:13:22,163 --> 00:13:23,996
I quit.

212
00:13:29,175 --> 00:13:33,260
Angela, you can't work here.

213
00:13:33,285 --> 00:13:35,902
Why not? I gave up
everything for this case.

214
00:13:35,954 --> 00:13:38,621
I don't want you to.

215
00:13:38,657 --> 00:13:42,268
<i>I am not here to help you
find purpose in your life.</i>

216
00:13:42,293 --> 00:13:44,743
If you need something to
do, take a jewelry class,

217
00:13:44,768 --> 00:13:48,302
but you can't work here.

218
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,611
After what I did,

219
00:13:50,636 --> 00:13:53,506
I won't be able to find
another job in tech.

220
00:13:53,531 --> 00:13:54,916
I'm broke.

221
00:13:54,941 --> 00:13:56,740
The lawsuit money won't come in for years.

222
00:13:56,765 --> 00:13:59,933
Which is why you need to
find something you can get.

223
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:01,720
But this is not it,

224
00:14:01,745 --> 00:14:03,969
not at this level for
what we're trying to do.

225
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,321
Hello?

226
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,712
John. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

227
00:14:08,737 --> 00:14:10,269
No, tell me.

228
00:14:10,354 --> 00:14:12,938
<i>Um... four?</i>

229
00:14:12,990 --> 00:14:15,274
<i>No, no, no, we're not
going down that road.</i>

230
00:14:15,326 --> 00:14:16,992
<i>Absolutely not.</i>

231
00:14:17,028 --> 00:14:18,528
<i>It's not happening.</i>

232
00:14:18,553 --> 00:14:20,770
No, it's gonna be six or nothing.

233
00:14:27,328 --> 00:14:29,565
- Who is this? <i>
- It's me.</i>

234
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:32,016
I'm looking for Elliot. He's not at work.

235
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:35,154
- I think he's flipping out again.
- What do you mean?

236
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,378
<i>He tried to kiss me last night.</i>

237
00:14:38,806 --> 00:14:41,423
<i>You're the one that found him
last time he was like this.</i>

238
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:46,418
I really need your help.

239
00:14:46,443 --> 00:14:48,832
Okay, where are you?

240
00:14:50,311 --> 00:14:52,945
It says so right here on the...

241
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:54,480
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

242
00:14:54,532 --> 00:14:55,648
Wow.

243
00:15:06,371 --> 00:15:08,621
He's not here.

244
00:15:08,646 --> 00:15:10,646
Let's keep thinking then.

245
00:15:10,682 --> 00:15:12,648
I have been.

246
00:15:12,684 --> 00:15:14,503
This was our runaway hideout.

247
00:15:14,528 --> 00:15:17,270
He always came here.

248
00:15:17,322 --> 00:15:20,523
Okay, let's spitball together.

249
00:15:20,575 --> 00:15:23,826
I can't help you.

250
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:25,695
What does that mean?

251
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:30,666
It means... I don't really
know Elliot any more.

252
00:15:30,702 --> 00:15:33,286
He has gone psycho legit this time, Angela.

253
00:15:33,338 --> 00:15:35,037
We are in a state of 911.

254
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,789
We just need to talk to him.

255
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:38,518
Yeah, well, he doesn't want to talk back.

256
00:15:38,543 --> 00:15:41,460
And if he does, it's
usually with a bunch of lies.

257
00:15:41,513 --> 00:15:44,900
We can't keep protecting
him from himself, Darlene.

258
00:15:44,925 --> 00:15:46,800
He has saved our asses multiple times,

259
00:15:46,851 --> 00:15:48,851
and you're just gonna do him like this?

260
00:15:48,887 --> 00:15:51,971
Why do you even care?

261
00:15:52,023 --> 00:15:53,556
What is that supposed to mean?

262
00:15:53,608 --> 00:15:56,392
It means you guys were never that close.

263
00:15:56,444 --> 00:15:58,227
In fact,

264
00:15:58,279 --> 00:16:03,399
he's been doing just fine until
you moved back to the city.

265
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:05,902
<i>Why are you even here?</i>

266
00:16:06,137 --> 00:16:09,004
Why have you and Elliot been
spending so much time together?

267
00:16:09,029 --> 00:16:11,213
Okay, you need to back off, babe.

268
00:16:11,242 --> 00:16:13,492
He is my brother, and
I'm just trying to help.

269
00:16:13,545 --> 00:16:15,488
That requires no explanation.

270
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:17,574
You don't want to tell me
what's really going on here,

271
00:16:17,599 --> 00:16:20,917
that's fine, but then
stop asking me for my help.

272
00:16:44,358 --> 00:16:49,328
I think we're good.

273
00:16:49,353 --> 00:16:51,520
Remember this?

274
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,654
Of course I do.

275
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:56,221
I think it's reasonable for
me to confirm given your...

276
00:16:56,246 --> 00:16:59,232
I even remember my game.

277
00:16:59,257 --> 00:17:01,707
I'd calculate the statistical probability

278
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,293
of safety for each car on the train

279
00:17:04,295 --> 00:17:07,296
based on how often they would derail.

280
00:17:07,298 --> 00:17:09,465
On the way there, I'd
always pick the safest car

281
00:17:09,467 --> 00:17:13,803
'cause I looked forward to
our trips to the city so much.

282
00:17:13,855 --> 00:17:18,975
Then on the way back, I'd
pick the most dangerous ones...

283
00:17:18,977 --> 00:17:21,477
'cause I hated going home.

284
00:17:24,046 --> 00:17:27,214
She's not there any more, Elliot.

285
00:17:27,239 --> 00:17:29,125
Look, I don't know where we're going,

286
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,599
but we need to find Darlene.

287
00:17:30,624 --> 00:17:32,290
- They may be after her...
- Shh.

288
00:17:39,293 --> 00:17:41,427
I thought that was you.

289
00:17:44,973 --> 00:17:48,642
Oh, my God. I haven't seen you in forever.

290
00:17:53,144 --> 00:17:54,844
We can't see Darlene right now.

291
00:17:54,846 --> 00:17:58,681
It's too risky.

292
00:17:58,733 --> 00:18:01,400
I know you're confused,
Elliot, but I'm gonna show you.

293
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:06,594
I'm gonna show you exactly
where I've been this whole time.

294
00:18:19,814 --> 00:18:21,514
<i>Look, calm down.</i>

295
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:23,673
<i>I'll figure this out.</i>

296
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,374
<i>I know you don't trust me.</i>

297
00:18:25,426 --> 00:18:27,293
<i>I wouldn't either,
but I'm telling you,</i>

298
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,046
<i>I'm remembering more and
more now as time goes on.</i>

299
00:18:30,098 --> 00:18:31,881
<i>That's a plus.</i>

300
00:18:31,933 --> 00:18:34,550
<i>It's all starting to come back,</i>

301
00:18:34,552 --> 00:18:36,218
<i>and once we get all the answers,</i>

302
00:18:36,270 --> 00:18:39,522
<i>I'll be back to normal,</i>

303
00:18:39,557 --> 00:18:41,691
<i>except for the fact
that my dead father</i>

304
00:18:41,726 --> 00:18:45,227
<i>isn't really dead and is
sitting across from me.</i>

305
00:19:00,756 --> 00:19:02,390
I'm gonna step outside and give you guys

306
00:19:02,426 --> 00:19:03,592
a moment to yourselves.

307
00:19:03,594 --> 00:19:05,488
We'll try feeding him again later, okay?

308
00:19:05,513 --> 00:19:07,313
Okay.

We're not letting anybody through.

342
00:21:48,857 --> 00:21:52,776
- No, I know the owner.
- Freddy, are you okay?

343
00:21:52,828 --> 00:21:54,321
Is everyone okay? What the hell happened?

344
00:21:54,346 --> 00:21:55,629
I'm still trying to
figure that one out myself.

345
00:21:55,654 --> 00:21:57,270
I was gone one day upstate.

346
00:21:57,295 --> 00:21:58,911
They're saying it was
electrical, but who knows?

347
00:21:58,936 --> 00:22:00,469
On hold with the insurance.

348
00:22:00,494 --> 00:22:02,661
Cocksuckers are doing their typical dance.

349
00:22:02,686 --> 00:22:04,616
Yeah, I was on hold?

350
00:22:04,641 --> 00:22:07,827
No, wait... not again.

351
00:22:09,247 --> 00:22:10,989
Well, I just came by to pick up some drives

352
00:22:11,014 --> 00:22:12,631
one of my employees dropped off yesterday.

353
00:22:12,656 --> 00:22:14,960
I'm sorry you wasted the trip.

354
00:22:14,985 --> 00:22:17,569
Everything's gone.

355
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:33,534
<i>Tyrell.</i>

356
00:22:33,586 --> 00:22:34,785
What was it?

357
00:22:34,837 --> 00:22:37,037
Boy?

358
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:39,123
Yeah.

359
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:40,541
Good.

360
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:42,126
Thank you for the flowers, sir.

361
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:44,508
If I'm being honest, it was Anwar

362
00:22:44,533 --> 00:22:46,714
who sent the flowers.

363
00:22:46,766 --> 00:22:49,550
He has a way with them.

364
00:22:52,605 --> 00:22:56,857
Tyrell, you don't know me
to beat around the bush,

365
00:22:56,892 --> 00:22:59,059
so I'll get right to it.

366
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:01,729
<i>Have a seat.</i>

367
00:23:01,781 --> 00:23:07,368
You understand the delicate
state we're in these days.

368
00:23:07,403 --> 00:23:09,570
As I'm sure you're aware, this situation

369
00:23:09,572 --> 00:23:13,374
with Sharon Knowles is... it's horrific.

370
00:23:13,409 --> 00:23:17,044
Scott is understandably devastated by it.

371
00:23:17,334 --> 00:23:18,917
Yeah, my heart goes out to him.

372
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:19,934
I don't know what I'd do if...

373
00:23:19,959 --> 00:23:22,460
Yeah, yeah, I know, I know, but...

374
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:26,253
The thing is that the police

375
00:23:26,255 --> 00:23:30,257
have indicated to Scott and to me

376
00:23:30,259 --> 00:23:35,396
that you are a person of interest.

377
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:38,098
They're suspicions are
based on information Scott

378
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:43,771
gave them about advances
you made on Sharon?

379
00:23:43,932 --> 00:23:46,798
Look, Tyrell, it was not lost on me

380
00:23:46,823 --> 00:23:50,611
that you and Scott had your
own competitive frictions.

381
00:23:50,613 --> 00:23:54,415
<i>Hell, the man nabbed CTO
right out from under you.</i>

382
00:23:54,450 --> 00:23:57,534
I'm sure his distress is
just causing him to lash out,

383
00:23:57,586 --> 00:23:59,536
and you're an easy target for him,

384
00:23:59,588 --> 00:24:03,457
and of course I doubt you're
involvement in this mishap,

385
00:24:03,459 --> 00:24:06,510
but... but...

386
00:24:09,553 --> 00:24:13,388
The problem remains.

387
00:24:15,354 --> 00:24:18,605
Scott will continue here,

388
00:24:18,641 --> 00:24:22,461
but you, I'm afraid, can not.

389
00:24:37,293 --> 00:24:40,577
I'm not sure what you're saying, Phillip.

390
00:24:45,501 --> 00:24:49,002
You know exactly what I'm saying.

391
00:24:50,917 --> 00:24:55,476
Phillip, you can't do this.

392
00:24:55,511 --> 00:24:57,845
You can't do this.

393
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,513
You can't!

394
00:24:59,515 --> 00:25:01,515
I've killed myself for this company!

395
00:25:01,517 --> 00:25:04,485
<i>I've been promoted
faster than anyone else!</i>

396
00:25:07,523 --> 00:25:09,690
You know, I can't deny I tried picturing

397
00:25:09,692 --> 00:25:12,493
your reaction.

398
00:25:12,528 --> 00:25:15,442
I seldom have time for such imaginings.

399
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:17,174
<i>For you, I was curious.</i>

400
00:25:17,199 --> 00:25:19,166
It could've gone any number of ways,

401
00:25:19,201 --> 00:25:22,202
and I found all the different
versions quite interesting,

402
00:25:22,204 --> 00:25:25,038
I admit, but now...

403
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:29,376
confronted with the reality...

404
00:25:29,378 --> 00:25:32,449
I have to say I'm disappointed.

405
00:25:33,265 --> 00:25:36,908
Phillip, please don't do this.

406
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,683
I was on a track.

407
00:25:49,398 --> 00:25:51,899
There was a moment, Tyrell,

408
00:25:51,901 --> 00:25:56,236
a point in your recent past,

409
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,621
a mistake,

410
00:25:57,673 --> 00:25:59,623
a compulsion, decision,

411
00:25:59,675 --> 00:26:05,378
something, that led you
to this point right now.

412
00:26:05,403 --> 00:26:07,520
My only advice to you is...

413
00:26:07,545 --> 00:26:11,547
find that moment,

414
00:26:11,553 --> 00:26:16,139
understand it.

415
00:26:16,164 --> 00:26:18,000
It's the only way to reconcile this...

416
00:26:18,025 --> 00:26:22,827
this failure with yourself.

417
00:26:22,916 --> 00:26:27,168
Please, sir, don't do this.

418
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:30,172
I'm begging you.

419
00:26:30,197 --> 00:26:38,056
I... I love this company.

420
00:27:01,603 --> 00:27:04,070
Mr. Wellick, you can't keep ignoring us.

421
00:27:04,106 --> 00:27:06,857
If you have any questions,
contact my lawyer.

422
00:27:06,909 --> 00:27:10,444
If you have evidence against me, charge me.

423
00:27:18,952 --> 00:27:20,863
I know I brought you back to township,

424
00:27:20,888 --> 00:27:24,222
but stopping by our old
house is not part of the plan.

425
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:26,480
Come on, these people
are gonna be home soon.

426
00:27:26,505 --> 00:27:27,921
Not the best time for a B and E.

427
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,496
This is where it happened, isn't it?

428
00:27:29,631 --> 00:27:33,133
What? Where what happened?

429
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:35,468
You remember anything about that window?

430
00:27:35,493 --> 00:27:37,861
Come on, Elliot.

431
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:39,585
Like I said, we should go.

432
00:27:39,641 --> 00:27:41,715
Elliot, what are you doing? Calm down.

433
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,621
Aah! Ugh!

434
00:27:43,646 --> 00:27:45,480
- You pushed me out this window.
- Elliot...

435
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:46,645
You pushed me off the boardwalk.

436
00:27:46,670 --> 00:27:48,203
- Hey, come on.
- No. Maybe you're the one

437
00:27:48,228 --> 00:27:49,527
who needs some pushing now.

438
00:27:49,552 --> 00:27:51,252
Calm down. It was an accident.

439
00:27:51,277 --> 00:27:52,986
Bullshit! I was eight years old.

440
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,621
You thought I deserved it.

441
00:27:54,656 --> 00:27:55,872
- That's what you said, isn't it?
- No, no.

442
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:57,407
Yeah, right before you pushed me again!

443
00:27:57,459 --> 00:27:59,993
No, no, no, Elliot, you
thought you deserved it.

444
00:28:00,045 --> 00:28:01,995
You felt guilty about this your whole life,

445
00:28:02,047 --> 00:28:03,663
about telling people my secret.

446
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:05,332
This anger was never at me.

447
00:28:05,334 --> 00:28:06,800
It was at you.

448
00:28:06,835 --> 00:28:08,468
Please, Elliot,

449
00:28:08,503 --> 00:28:10,503
you don't have to be
angry at yourself any more.

450
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:11,671
Just let it go.

451
00:28:11,673 --> 00:28:13,173
Please let it go.

452
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,508
You're right. I was angry.

453
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,177
I was angry at myself.

454
00:28:17,221 --> 00:28:22,101
I hated myself for doing what I did to you.

455
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:23,957
I'm ready to let go.

456
00:28:23,982 --> 00:28:25,147
Aah!

457
00:29:03,454 --> 00:29:06,238
Gonna work in the garden a little.

458
00:29:06,263 --> 00:29:08,480
It'd be nice if you wanted to help.

459
00:29:11,629 --> 00:29:14,913
Oh, by the way, you didn't tell
me Darlene was back in town.

460
00:29:14,938 --> 00:29:17,276
<i>I haven't seen her
back here in a while.</i>

461
00:29:17,301 --> 00:29:18,717
What did you say?

462
00:29:18,752 --> 00:29:22,087
Darlene. At least, I think it was her.

463
00:29:22,139 --> 00:29:26,341
You saw her? Where?

464
00:29:26,393 --> 00:29:28,510
I'm telling you, I did not get notification

465
00:29:28,562 --> 00:29:29,893
of the request.

466
00:29:29,918 --> 00:29:32,445
That server needs to remain
a honey pot, off the network.

467
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:33,765
<i>Sir, I have the request
right here from yesterday.</i>

468
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:35,219
I'm trying to tell you, Jim,

469
00:29:35,245 --> 00:29:37,161
our network was compromised yesterday.

470
00:29:37,186 --> 00:29:38,518
I did not make the request.

471
00:29:38,543 --> 00:29:40,095
Someone else obviously did,

472
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:41,993
so you need to take the
server off the network,

473
00:29:42,018 --> 00:29:43,419
or something's gonna happen.

474
00:29:43,444 --> 00:29:45,027
<i>I just can't do that, sir.</i>

475
00:29:45,055 --> 00:29:46,547
<i>We have specific orders
from Tyrell Wellick</i>

476
00:29:46,572 --> 00:29:48,288
<i>to keep the request as is.</i>

477
00:29:48,313 --> 00:29:50,430
That just doesn't make any sense.

478
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:52,702
Look, I need to speak to your supervisor.

479
00:30:02,427 --> 00:30:06,062
Hello?

480
00:30:06,087 --> 00:30:08,470
Is anyone here?

481
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,500
Hello?

482
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:28,277
Oh, Jesus.

483
00:30:28,588 --> 00:30:30,288
I ran out of places to look,

484
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:33,541
so I figured I'd try the
last place he'd ever be.

485
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:35,793
Struck out again.

486
00:30:35,818 --> 00:30:37,827
Oh, God.

487
00:30:38,087 --> 00:30:41,922
I haven't been here in years.

488
00:30:42,033 --> 00:30:45,701
The new family that just
moved in is so weird,

489
00:30:45,726 --> 00:30:48,227
especially the dad.

490
00:30:51,277 --> 00:30:55,229
They didn't really change much.

491
00:30:55,281 --> 00:30:57,782
You okay?

492
00:30:57,817 --> 00:30:59,150
Yeah.

493
00:31:00,176 --> 00:31:01,292
Shit.

494
00:31:01,321 --> 00:31:03,481
Weird new dad's back.

495
00:31:20,306 --> 00:31:23,174
I'm sorry, by the way.

496
00:31:23,226 --> 00:31:26,093
For what?

497
00:31:26,145 --> 00:31:30,898
I should be more open
with you, your family.

498
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:36,179
Okay, okay.

499
00:31:36,204 --> 00:31:38,788
Don't get all mushy on me now.

500
00:31:44,724 --> 00:31:48,393
Do you see that?

501
00:31:48,418 --> 00:31:50,201
Wasn't that Elliot's room?

502
00:31:58,021 --> 00:32:01,350
We're almost there. Almost there.

503
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:04,181
Why... Why are we here?

504
00:32:04,217 --> 00:32:06,183
I thought you said we
were going somewhere safe.

505
00:32:06,219 --> 00:32:08,219
Aah!

506
00:32:08,271 --> 00:32:10,388
<i>Elliot!</i>

507
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,223
Elliot!

508
00:32:12,252 --> 00:32:14,002
Shit.

509
00:32:14,027 --> 00:32:16,644
What the hell are they doing here?

510
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:18,803
Won't be long now.

511
00:32:18,828 --> 00:32:20,258
I tried to protect you, son,

512
00:32:20,283 --> 00:32:21,816
but they caught up to us.

513
00:32:21,845 --> 00:32:24,389
<i>- Elliot!</i>
- What are you talking about?

514
00:32:24,414 --> 00:32:26,881
That's Darlene and Angela.

515
00:32:26,906 --> 00:32:29,874
Trust me, son, I wanted to tell you sooner.

516
00:32:29,909 --> 00:32:32,243
Things got too accelerated
at the end there.

517
00:32:32,268 --> 00:32:34,218
You have to believe that.

518
00:32:34,247 --> 00:32:37,248
No matter what anyone tries
to do, I will never leave you.

519
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,216
I will always be right here.

520
00:32:39,252 --> 00:32:40,835
Do you understand that? They
are not going to break us

521
00:32:40,887 --> 00:32:42,405
- apart again.
- What's going on?

522
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:43,783
- Listen to me.
- Tell me right now!

523
00:32:43,808 --> 00:32:45,556
Listen to me because
we don't have much time.

524
00:32:45,581 --> 00:32:46,659
They're gonna try and get rid of me again,

525
00:32:46,684 --> 00:32:48,236
and I need you to not let them!

526
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:49,677
Why would they get rid of you?

527
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:50,845
Please, Elliot, listen to me.

528
00:32:50,897 --> 00:32:53,848
I will never leave you.

529
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:58,309
I will never leave you alone again.

530
00:32:58,334 --> 00:33:01,802
I love you, son.

531
00:33:12,258 --> 00:33:14,258
What's he talking about?

532
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:16,816
What's he talking about?

533
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:19,066
Hey, I want to know.

534
00:33:19,091 --> 00:33:21,291
I want to know.

535
00:33:21,316 --> 00:33:23,600
I want to know!

536
00:33:23,714 --> 00:33:27,299
Elliot, who are you talking to?

537
00:33:29,972 --> 00:33:32,523
What do you mean? I'm talking to...

538
00:33:40,546 --> 00:33:45,799
Stay back. Stay back.

539
00:33:45,824 --> 00:33:48,331
Elliot, you're bleeding.

540
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:53,077
Aah.

541
00:33:53,102 --> 00:33:54,935
<i>Elliot... </i>

542
00:33:55,535 --> 00:33:57,901
Aah.

543
00:34:02,375 --> 00:34:06,326
Elliot, what are you doing here?

544
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:10,353
You didn't see him?

545
00:34:10,378 --> 00:34:13,546
Who?

546
00:34:13,571 --> 00:34:16,038
Aah!

547
00:34:16,349 --> 00:34:17,681
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

548
00:34:17,683 --> 00:34:19,183
<i>This can't be happening.</i>

549
00:34:19,185 --> 00:34:21,569
- <i>This can't be happening.</i>
- No...

550
00:34:29,302 --> 00:34:32,003
<i>This is happening, isn't it?</i>

551
00:34:36,905 --> 00:34:40,440
<i>You knew all along, didn't you?</i>

552
00:34:47,854 --> 00:34:53,608
Elliot, who do you think
you've been talking to?

553
00:34:56,370 --> 00:34:59,088
<i>You're gonna make me
say it, aren't you?</i>

554
00:35:03,328 --> 00:35:05,871
<i>I'm Mr. Robot.</i>

555
00:35:21,687 --> 00:35:26,807
You're gonna be okay.

556
00:35:26,832 --> 00:35:30,034
I think I'm pretty [bleep] far from okay.

557
00:35:33,110 --> 00:35:36,611
Don't take this the wrong way,

558
00:35:36,636 --> 00:35:38,436
but I envy you.

559
00:35:41,596 --> 00:35:45,464
I wish I could talk to my mom again,

560
00:35:45,489 --> 00:35:47,823
even if she isn't real.

561
00:36:10,325 --> 00:36:14,168
Take care of yourself, okay?

562
00:36:28,343 --> 00:36:30,927
I know you don't feel
like talking about it...

563
00:36:30,979 --> 00:36:33,596
You're right, I don't.

564
00:36:33,648 --> 00:36:37,017
Unfortunately I need to know, Elliot,

565
00:36:37,042 --> 00:36:40,154
given what we've been doing.

566
00:36:40,835 --> 00:36:43,468
<i>I just need to know.</i>

567
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:48,247
Do you remember any of it?

568
00:36:51,068 --> 00:36:53,902
Remember what?

569
00:36:53,927 --> 00:36:57,317
When we first started fsociety.

570
00:37:05,206 --> 00:37:07,656
Is Mr. Wellick in?

571
00:37:07,681 --> 00:37:10,182
Oh, hi, Mr. Goddard.

572
00:37:10,207 --> 00:37:11,891
No, he's gone.

573
00:37:11,916 --> 00:37:13,353
He was, um...

574
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:15,148
He was let go today.

575
00:37:15,173 --> 00:37:19,225
What? Why?

576
00:37:19,250 --> 00:37:21,501
I don't know.

577
00:37:21,944 --> 00:37:24,227
<i>He wasn't always the
easiest person to deal with.</i>

578
00:37:24,252 --> 00:37:25,565
I... I'm sure.

579
00:37:25,577 --> 00:37:30,547
Uh, do you think you can get
me in to see Scott Knowles?

580
00:37:30,572 --> 00:37:35,041
- It's urgent.
- Oh, no, definitely not now.

581
00:37:35,077 --> 00:37:36,910
<i>You haven't heard?</i>

582
00:38:07,136 --> 00:38:09,503
Dad, what's going on?

583
00:38:09,544 --> 00:38:12,860
I'll let you two talk.

584
00:38:17,769 --> 00:38:21,307
I know, I know, but hey, you
popped in over at my home.

585
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:24,390
I figured I'd return the favor.

586
00:38:24,419 --> 00:38:26,253
What do you want?

587
00:38:26,278 --> 00:38:28,978
To offer you something you may want.

588
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:31,981
Come on in.

589
00:38:32,033 --> 00:38:33,483
If this is about the case...

590
00:38:33,512 --> 00:38:34,878
Please. I don't care about the case.

591
00:38:34,903 --> 00:38:36,069
I don't even understand the case.

592
00:38:36,121 --> 00:38:38,071
I have lawyers for that.

593
00:38:38,123 --> 00:38:40,373
Then what?

594
00:38:42,304 --> 00:38:45,089
You boys can wait outside.

595
00:38:49,631 --> 00:38:53,797
So I got to be honest,
I was impressed by you.

596
00:38:53,822 --> 00:38:55,688
Sure, your career's finished,

597
00:38:55,713 --> 00:38:57,804
but you played a great short game.

598
00:38:57,829 --> 00:39:00,463
You took a big gamble, and
you got what you wanted.

599
00:39:00,488 --> 00:39:03,705
It was just, you know,
the wrong thing to want.

600
00:39:10,776 --> 00:39:12,642
What do you care?

601
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:15,585
You know, I looked into
you over there at Allsafe.

602
00:39:15,610 --> 00:39:17,389
I mean, lots of people

603
00:39:17,414 --> 00:39:19,170
would've settled into
middle management bliss

604
00:39:19,195 --> 00:39:20,446
after all the shit you've taken,

605
00:39:20,471 --> 00:39:21,851
but you didn't.

606
00:39:21,876 --> 00:39:23,732
You're relentless and
smart, and that combination

607
00:39:23,757 --> 00:39:27,795
is very valuable to a
lot of important people,

608
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:30,123
people I know.

609
00:39:30,148 --> 00:39:33,312
Where are you going with all of this?

610
00:39:33,628 --> 00:39:39,030
I think I can land you
a pretty lucrative gig.

611
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,804
A gig? Where?

612
00:39:44,829 --> 00:39:48,671
Your favorite place, where else?

613
00:39:51,446 --> 00:39:55,148
You slummed it all the way
down to Jersey in person

614
00:39:55,200 --> 00:39:59,485
to offer me a job at the
company I'm currently suing?

615
00:39:59,510 --> 00:40:01,677
What's the real ask here?

616
00:40:01,706 --> 00:40:03,823
I think you'd make a great business woman.

617
00:40:03,852 --> 00:40:07,101
I'm afraid it's nothing more than that.

618
00:40:07,133 --> 00:40:08,984
- Is this a joke?
- <i> It's no joke.</i>

619
00:40:09,009 --> 00:40:10,673
My pals think you can
bring a lot to the table.

620
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:12,898
You can't be offering me a job there.

621
00:40:12,900 --> 00:40:14,900
<i>You're testifying against them.</i>

622
00:40:14,925 --> 00:40:16,763
So, you'll find this out fairly soon,

623
00:40:16,788 --> 00:40:19,905
but in business, grudges
aren't really a thing.

624
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:21,296
It's too emotional.

625
00:40:21,321 --> 00:40:22,988
<i>It's because you pulled off</i>

626
00:40:23,013 --> 00:40:24,937
<i>what you pulled off
that they called me.</i>

627
00:40:24,962 --> 00:40:28,047
This is a huge class action lawsuit.

628
00:40:28,072 --> 00:40:30,072
They are going to pay millions.

629
00:40:30,084 --> 00:40:32,579
<i>Roughly 75 to 100 million.</i>

630
00:40:32,604 --> 00:40:34,977
I mean, that's what their
lawyers will settle for

631
00:40:35,002 --> 00:40:37,283
after they exhaust most
of your legal team's funds

632
00:40:37,308 --> 00:40:39,341
for the next seven years.

633
00:40:39,366 --> 00:40:41,066
<i>And sure, that is...
that's a lot of money,</i>

634
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:43,208
<i>but not to them, not really.</i>

635
00:40:43,233 --> 00:40:44,957
We started a rainy-day fund

636
00:40:44,982 --> 00:40:47,433
when the leak happened
just for this occasion.

637
00:40:47,485 --> 00:40:50,964
The fund itself has already
made five times that amount.

638
00:40:59,251 --> 00:41:01,334
I'd like to ask you to leave.

639
00:41:01,359 --> 00:41:02,725
Shall I pass your name along then?

640
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,533
I'm not working there.

641
00:41:04,585 --> 00:41:06,118
They killed my mother.

642
00:41:06,170 --> 00:41:07,953
And every fast food joint around the corner

643
00:41:07,978 --> 00:41:10,596
delivers diabetes to millions of people.

644
00:41:10,621 --> 00:41:13,269
Phillip Morris hands out lung
cancer on the hour, every hour.

645
00:41:13,294 --> 00:41:14,684
I mean, hell,

646
00:41:14,709 --> 00:41:18,082
everyone's destroying the planet
beyond the point of no return.

647
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:20,566
Are you really gonna start
taking all of these things

648
00:41:20,591 --> 00:41:21,707
so personally?

649
00:41:21,732 --> 00:41:23,264
Maybe I will.

650
00:41:23,289 --> 00:41:24,822
Maybe someone has to.

651
00:41:24,847 --> 00:41:26,082
<i>A suggestion:</i>

652
00:41:26,107 --> 00:41:27,857
If you want to change things,

653
00:41:27,882 --> 00:41:32,552
perhaps you should try from within,

654
00:41:32,577 --> 00:41:37,830
because this is what
happens from the outside.

655
00:41:37,855 --> 00:41:39,679
<i>These guys don't wait on anyone,</i>

656
00:41:39,704 --> 00:41:42,154
<i>so you'll have to let
them know by tomorrow.</i>

657
00:41:43,301 --> 00:41:45,551
I'll show myself out.

658
00:42:09,971 --> 00:42:12,539
These are all empty.

659
00:42:12,575 --> 00:42:18,078
Are you just filling them and dumping them?

660
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:21,054
Where are your new 'scrips?

661
00:42:21,083 --> 00:42:23,750
What does it matter?

662
00:42:23,803 --> 00:42:29,389
I don't even know what's real any more.

663
00:42:29,425 --> 00:42:32,571
Look, I know you feel shitty right now,

664
00:42:32,596 --> 00:42:33,927
but once you take your meds...

665
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:37,204
Maybe we should stop it, Darlene.

666
00:42:37,233 --> 00:42:39,433
Stop what?

667
00:42:39,458 --> 00:42:41,291
The plan.

668
00:42:41,320 --> 00:42:42,853
The hack. Everything.

669
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:45,105
Maybe we shouldn't execute it.

670
00:42:45,157 --> 00:42:47,441
What? Why?

671
00:42:47,443 --> 00:42:50,274
The minute our infected server
gets back on the main network,

672
00:42:50,299 --> 00:42:53,280
- we're set.
- It wasn't me.

673
00:42:53,332 --> 00:42:58,919
The whole time, it wasn't
really me doing all of that.

674
00:42:58,954 --> 00:43:04,091
Elliot, the reasons we wanted to do this,

675
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:06,426
the reasons why we all wanted to do this,

676
00:43:06,462 --> 00:43:09,310
are real.

677
00:43:09,335 --> 00:43:13,837
Maybe you don't realize
this, but this was your idea.

678
00:43:13,862 --> 00:43:17,531
You came up with this.

679
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:20,668
There is a part of you,
somewhere deep down inside,

680
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:24,027
that knows this is the right thing to do.

681
00:43:27,935 --> 00:43:29,793
I'm gonna get your meds.

682
00:43:29,818 --> 00:43:31,985
We'll talk more when I get back, okay?

683
00:43:36,943 --> 00:43:38,955
Come on.

684
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,017
<i>What would you do if
you were in my shoes?</i>

685
00:43:51,042 --> 00:43:54,076
<i>I know. I know, I'm
officially crazy,</i>

686
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:58,560
<i>but the plan isn't, is it?</i>

687
00:44:06,276 --> 00:44:07,599
What the hell are you...

688
00:44:07,624 --> 00:44:09,006
Shh.

689
00:44:25,085 --> 00:44:28,711
I've been waiting outside
your apartment until she left.

690
00:44:28,736 --> 00:44:31,904
Didn't want anyone to know I'm here.

691
00:44:31,929 --> 00:44:33,879
I know you're behind it,

692
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:38,005
all of it, fsociety, the server,

693
00:44:38,030 --> 00:44:40,388
Colby, Allsafe.

694
00:44:40,413 --> 00:44:43,864
You're the one constant
in a sea of variables.

695
00:44:51,579 --> 00:44:55,498
Elliot...

696
00:44:55,523 --> 00:44:59,934
now, I don't know what your grand plan is,

697
00:44:59,959 --> 00:45:02,242
but I need to, and you're going to tell me.

698
00:45:13,271 --> 00:45:19,108
Two days ago I strangled a woman
to death just with my hands.

699
00:45:19,133 --> 00:45:22,101
That's a strange sensation.

700
00:45:26,758 --> 00:45:28,675
Something so tremendous done

701
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:31,701
by something so simple.

702
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:39,487
The first ten seconds
were... uncomfortable,

703
00:45:39,512 --> 00:45:42,146
a feeling of limbo,

704
00:45:42,171 --> 00:45:44,131
but then your muscles tense,

705
00:45:44,156 --> 00:45:47,621
and she struggles and fights,

706
00:45:47,673 --> 00:45:49,623
but it almost disappears in the background

707
00:45:49,675 --> 00:45:54,261
along with everything else in the world.

708
00:45:54,296 --> 00:45:59,966
At that moment it's just
you and absolute power,

709
00:45:59,968 --> 00:46:04,700
nothing else.

710
00:46:04,725 --> 00:46:07,092
That moment stayed with me.

711
00:46:12,317 --> 00:46:16,152
I thought I'd feel guilty
for being a murderer,

712
00:46:16,177 --> 00:46:20,796
but... I don't.

713
00:46:20,821 --> 00:46:23,154
I feel wonder.

714
00:46:44,605 --> 00:46:48,640
How long has this been going on?

715
00:46:48,665 --> 00:46:50,885
I don't know.

716
00:46:57,033 --> 00:47:00,026
And what is it that you're doing exactly?

717
00:47:00,079 --> 00:47:04,030
<i>Encrypting all the files.</i>

718
00:47:04,055 --> 00:47:06,222
All of Evil Corp's financial records

719
00:47:06,251 --> 00:47:08,869
will be impossible to access.

720
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:10,688
The encryption key will self-delete

721
00:47:10,713 --> 00:47:12,539
after the process completes.

722
00:47:12,564 --> 00:47:13,680
What about the backups?

723
00:47:13,705 --> 00:47:15,671
I took care of that too.

724
00:47:15,696 --> 00:47:18,363
- Chainang.
- Steel Mountain.

725
00:47:18,380 --> 00:47:20,774
Of course, even when we went redundant.

726
00:47:20,799 --> 00:47:23,183
I hacked the Air Dream network.

727
00:47:23,218 --> 00:47:25,635
I was in all of them.

728
00:47:25,687 --> 00:47:29,639
You really thought of everything.

729
00:47:29,691 --> 00:47:34,144
Who else was involved?

730
00:47:34,196 --> 00:47:36,363
Just me.

731
00:47:39,096 --> 00:47:42,548
Well, now it's you and me.

732
00:47:42,573 --> 00:47:45,741
I've always told you we'd end
up working together, Elliot.

733
00:47:49,073 --> 00:47:54,025
But still, I have to know.

734
00:47:54,050 --> 00:47:56,684
Why did you do it?

735
00:47:59,333 --> 00:48:02,784
What did you hope to
accomplish by doing all of this?

736
00:48:07,943 --> 00:48:09,943
I don't know.

737
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:20,404
I wanted to save the world.
