1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,469
Steel Mountain. The hacker's dilemma.

2
00:00:02,470 --> 00:00:05,349
What to do when a bunch
of data you want to destroy

3
00:00:05,350 --> 00:00:07,140
is completely off the grid?

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,620
Hello, Evil Corp. We are FSociety.

5
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:15,129
Man of the hour. Take a curtsy.

6
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,010
Dark Army?

7
00:00:16,011 --> 00:00:17,719
They got no code. They hack for anyone:

8
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,589
Terrorists, North Korea, Iran, Russia...

9
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,609
Yo, yo, yo, yo, my album just dropped.

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,760
Please buy my CD.

11
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:24,389
He has my bank account, Ollie.

12
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:27,965
We cannot just infect Allsafe's
network because of this.

13
00:00:28,017 --> 00:00:29,906
Can we please hear the plan?

14
00:00:29,940 --> 00:00:31,874
Where are we at with Steel Mountain?

15
00:00:31,909 --> 00:00:33,209
I know how to take out the backups

16
00:00:33,243 --> 00:00:35,122
without blowing up the pipeline.

17
00:00:36,914 --> 00:00:39,148
What do normal people do
when they get this sad?

18
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:42,118
They reach out to friends or family.

19
00:00:42,152 --> 00:00:43,352
I do morphine.

20
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:12,648
There it is.

21
00:01:12,683 --> 00:01:15,251
After all the searching, scraping, dusting,

22
00:01:15,285 --> 00:01:17,019
that's all that's left.

23
00:01:17,054 --> 00:01:20,323
One line. The last line.

24
00:01:20,357 --> 00:01:23,192
The consequences of busting
Vera and meeting Mr. Robot,

25
00:01:23,226 --> 00:01:27,129
creating you... everything
till now, this moment.

26
00:01:27,164 --> 00:01:30,366
I chose this. I chose all this.

27
00:01:34,171 --> 00:01:36,772
Data storage facilities
like Steel Mountain...

28
00:01:36,807 --> 00:01:40,176
it's linear-tape open standard 9.

29
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:42,945
Temp value between 61 and 95.

30
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:44,647
Iron oxide in mag tape...

31
00:01:44,681 --> 00:01:47,717
it sticks to polyurethane with a binder.

32
00:01:54,558 --> 00:01:58,894
If HVAC conditions surpass
the ceiling 95 degrees,

33
00:01:58,929 --> 00:02:02,598
polyurethane adhesive mollifies
and tape data is unreadable.

34
00:02:24,054 --> 00:02:25,821
This is what we're doing.

35
00:02:25,856 --> 00:02:29,225
This circuit board, if
installed behind a thermostat,

36
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:31,694
it lets us plant an asymmetric back door

37
00:02:31,728 --> 00:02:35,498
then create a VPN in the
Steel Mountain intranet.

38
00:02:35,532 --> 00:02:38,334
Okay, we all know what a Raspberry Pi is.

39
00:02:38,368 --> 00:02:39,902
What's your point?

40
00:02:42,072 --> 00:02:43,773
He wants to hack Steel Mountain's

41
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,074
climate control system,

42
00:02:45,108 --> 00:02:47,243
raise the facility's heat high enough

43
00:02:47,277 --> 00:02:50,112
to destroy all the tapes.

44
00:02:50,147 --> 00:02:52,181
And you think sticking
this behind the thermostat

45
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:55,117
will do all that?

46
00:02:55,152 --> 00:02:57,686
With the right software
specifically designed.

47
00:02:57,721 --> 00:02:59,555
I'll pull up my research on the facility,

48
00:02:59,589 --> 00:03:00,923
start targeting which thermostats

49
00:03:00,957 --> 00:03:02,391
are the most accessible.

50
00:03:02,426 --> 00:03:03,793
Yeah, well, that's all well and good,

51
00:03:03,827 --> 00:03:05,961
but we still gotta get in the damn joint.

52
00:03:07,798 --> 00:03:10,433
There. Deep in the Adirondacks.

53
00:03:10,467 --> 00:03:13,769
In 145-plus acre former limestone mine.

54
00:03:13,804 --> 00:03:18,307
3-ton steel gates, 24/7 armed guards,

55
00:03:18,341 --> 00:03:21,710
closed circuit cameras, NOC staffing.

56
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,113
Sure you don't want to just blow it up?

57
00:03:29,486 --> 00:03:32,755
All we need is one security flaw.

58
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:36,258
Look at this place, man. It
was built not to have any.

59
00:03:38,095 --> 00:03:41,664
I see about... six walking around.

60
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:52,441
You okay, man?

61
00:03:55,445 --> 00:03:57,012
What the hell?

62
00:03:57,047 --> 00:03:59,181
Where you going?

63
00:03:59,216 --> 00:04:02,084
We're done, aren't we?

64
00:04:02,119 --> 00:04:04,854
That was about the time
the withdrawal started.

65
00:04:04,888 --> 00:04:06,155
Remember?

66
00:04:10,327 --> 00:04:12,995
I know... I broke my own rule.

67
00:04:13,029 --> 00:04:14,930
But I have no Suboxone.

68
00:04:14,965 --> 00:04:18,834
What I do have... clinical
depression, social anxiety.

69
00:04:18,869 --> 00:04:22,371
A day job, a night job,
confusing relationships.

70
00:04:22,405 --> 00:04:24,473
Others depending on me.

71
00:04:24,508 --> 00:04:27,843
Taking down the largest
corporation in the world.

72
00:04:27,878 --> 00:04:29,011
And I chose it all.

73
00:04:30,714 --> 00:04:33,616
This line has wanted
to own me my whole life.

74
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:37,286
Biosynthesized in some lab
in Mexico, packed into a pill,

75
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,288
shipped to the States where it was packaged

76
00:04:39,322 --> 00:04:41,624
with a logo and taxed by the government,

77
00:04:41,658 --> 00:04:44,493
stolen by a bribed guard,
sold to a Vera henchman,

78
00:04:44,528 --> 00:04:47,663
oversold to Shayla, and then to me.

79
00:04:47,697 --> 00:04:51,133
It needs me just as much as I need it.

80
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:53,502
The moment was destined,
every choice bringing me

81
00:04:53,537 --> 00:04:55,708
closer to this one line.

82
00:04:55,742 --> 00:04:58,844
This line. This last line.

83
00:04:59,778 --> 00:05:01,179
I promise.

84
00:05:03,071 --> 00:05:05,940
Synced and corrected by sk?ad

85
00:05:10,156 --> 00:05:12,057
Today will be the worst of it.

86
00:05:12,092 --> 00:05:15,394
Get through the next couple
days, and then I'll be clean.

87
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:36,648
What do you want?

88
00:05:41,588 --> 00:05:43,255
Huh?

89
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:13,106
It's me. Open up.

90
00:06:15,625 --> 00:06:17,259
I would have saved you the trip to the door

91
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:20,295
but you're all, like, against
me breaking in or whatever.

92
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,834
Why are you here?

93
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,803
Romero got some clarity on your little plan

94
00:06:27,837 --> 00:06:29,337
that's gonna need your undivided.

95
00:06:30,773 --> 00:06:34,109
- Okay, let's go.
- What's going on with you?

96
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,544
You look like shit.

97
00:06:36,846 --> 00:06:38,647
I'm fine.

98
00:06:47,590 --> 00:06:51,793
Look, man. This plan's not gonna work.

99
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:54,629
Why? Why is that?

100
00:06:54,664 --> 00:06:56,164
I was doing recon on Steel Mountain.

101
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,666
Came up with a problem. A big, fat one.

102
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:00,836
Evil Corp's upping their security protocol.

103
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:04,473
If you ask me, it's
overkill, but it's legit.

104
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:06,741
I already told you, they
have their vulnerabilities.

105
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:09,644
So what happens after we
hack the New York facility?

106
00:07:09,679 --> 00:07:11,480
Then we have to take a trip to Nashville,

107
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,949
then Colorado, then San Jose,

108
00:07:13,983 --> 00:07:16,318
then goddamn Tallahassee.

109
00:07:18,254 --> 00:07:20,889
Ugh, this looks real bad. Real bad.

110
00:07:20,923 --> 00:07:22,958
They are physically copying then shipping

111
00:07:22,992 --> 00:07:24,726
all the analog backups.

112
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,729
Five big-ass fortress-like
redundancies across the country.

113
00:07:27,763 --> 00:07:30,632
Now maybe... and it was
always a big maybe...

114
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,801
we get into one, but no
way we get into all of them.

115
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:35,237
The minute we fry one facility,

116
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:38,473
they'll patch every climate
control system they own.

117
00:07:38,508 --> 00:07:40,842
No matter how you slice
it, the plan is DOA.

118
00:07:40,877 --> 00:07:42,711
Where'd you get this?

119
00:07:42,745 --> 00:07:44,045
What the hell do you mean?

120
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,549
We're still in Evil Corp's network.

121
00:07:47,583 --> 00:07:50,318
Shit.

122
00:07:50,353 --> 00:07:52,754
This is what Tyrell was talking about.

123
00:07:52,788 --> 00:07:55,590
What'd you just say? Tyrell?

124
00:07:55,625 --> 00:07:58,426
As in Tyrell Wellick?

125
00:07:58,461 --> 00:08:00,996
Yeah.

126
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:03,331
Since when did you and the goddamn CTO

127
00:08:03,366 --> 00:08:06,935
of Evil Corp become, what, chums?

128
00:08:06,969 --> 00:08:10,171
Says this isn't happening till April 1st.

129
00:08:10,206 --> 00:08:13,575
It's only the 29th.

130
00:08:13,609 --> 00:08:15,710
We still got a few days.

131
00:08:15,745 --> 00:08:17,846
We have time.

132
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:21,049
All their tapes are still
in the New York facility.

133
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,486
Just means we go up today.

134
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,292
We're nowhere close to being ready.

135
00:08:30,326 --> 00:08:32,961
Well, I've already downloaded
all the necessary PDFs

136
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:35,630
of the floor plans to
target the thermostats.

137
00:08:35,665 --> 00:08:36,865
It will require some planning,

138
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,400
but nothing I can't do in the car.

139
00:08:39,215 --> 00:08:40,310
It shouldn't take me long to own

140
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:41,570
the facility's SCADA network.

141
00:08:41,604 --> 00:08:43,972
Especially with some help.

142
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:45,240
You guys hit the road

143
00:08:45,274 --> 00:08:47,709
while Trenton helps me finish the distro.

144
00:08:47,743 --> 00:08:49,411
We'll double-time it.

145
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,446
You can get it off the FTP
server as soon as you get there.

146
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,981
What about China?

147
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:54,749
We'd have to execute
the hack before Tuesday.

148
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:56,585
Don't worry about China.

149
00:08:56,619 --> 00:08:59,487
I'll it up my Dark Army
contact as soon as you take off.

150
00:08:59,522 --> 00:09:01,256
Oh, you just gonna hit up

151
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,126
the world's most dangerous hacker crew?

152
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:09,664
Pssh, ya'll have gone and
misplaced your collective minds.

153
00:09:09,699 --> 00:09:11,833
We've been planning this for months.

154
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:14,235
Now we're gonna go up on a
lark just 'cause he said so?

155
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,339
This plan is shit.

156
00:09:17,373 --> 00:09:19,140
The plan will work.

157
00:09:19,175 --> 00:09:21,476
And once we're actually
there, I still need to prep

158
00:09:21,510 --> 00:09:23,845
the social engineering,
plus we have no idea

159
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:26,181
who physically's gonna go in.

160
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:33,822
It's my plan. I'll go in.

161
00:09:33,856 --> 00:09:36,925
Look, man, you...

162
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,526
you might be able to
hide it from these nerds,

163
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:41,096
but I know a junkie when I see one.

164
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,198
In your condition, you
ain't gonna do Jack or Jill

165
00:09:43,232 --> 00:09:44,766
except puke your brains out

166
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,701
or give hand jobs for another high.

167
00:09:46,736 --> 00:09:50,305
Like you said, in three days,
one Steel Mountain becomes five.

168
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:53,341
That's no good for any plan.

169
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:57,879
Something ain't right about this guy.

170
00:09:57,913 --> 00:10:01,383
Yeah, well. He's gotten us this far.

171
00:10:01,417 --> 00:10:03,351
Still, I don't trust him.

172
00:10:03,386 --> 00:10:07,422
Well, it's not about trust, remember?

173
00:10:11,727 --> 00:10:13,561
Thank you, Mom.

174
00:10:18,601 --> 00:10:22,404
- There it is.
- All right.

175
00:10:22,438 --> 00:10:24,139
Come to Daddy.

176
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:35,116
Yeah. Ha ha ha.

177
00:10:56,138 --> 00:10:59,207
Yo, man.

178
00:10:59,241 --> 00:11:01,910
You gonna say anything about this?

179
00:11:01,944 --> 00:11:03,211
What's there to say?

180
00:11:03,245 --> 00:11:05,680
You seem to have everything under control.

181
00:11:05,715 --> 00:11:07,982
Yeah. Okay.

182
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:13,722
This isn't my operation.

183
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:27,035
I told you before.

184
00:11:27,069 --> 00:11:29,104
You're the key to the whole thing.

185
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:31,906
You're the only force
of nature at play here.

186
00:11:44,153 --> 00:11:46,921
There's a saying.

187
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:48,723
The devil's at his strongest

188
00:11:48,758 --> 00:11:50,759
while we're looking the other way,

189
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,928
like a program running in
the background silently,

190
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,632
while we're busy doing other shit.

191
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,601
Daemons, they call them.

192
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:02,837
They perform action
without user interaction.

193
00:12:02,872 --> 00:12:07,308
Monitoring, logging, notifications.

194
00:12:07,343 --> 00:12:12,113
Primal urges, repressed
memories, unconscious habits.

195
00:12:12,148 --> 00:12:15,650
They're always there, always active.

196
00:12:15,684 --> 00:12:18,987
We can try to be right,
we can try to be good.

197
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:20,922
We can try to make a difference,

198
00:12:20,956 --> 00:12:22,857
but it's all bullshit.

199
00:12:22,892 --> 00:12:25,026
'Cause intentions are irrelevant.

200
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:28,263
They don't drive us. Daemons do.

201
00:12:28,297 --> 00:12:30,899
And me? I've got more than most.

202
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,830
I just need to rest a
minute, okay? I'll be fine.

203
00:12:37,864 --> 00:12:39,531
Bullshit... a couple hours,

204
00:12:39,566 --> 00:12:41,690
you'll wish you felt as
shitty as you do right now.

205
00:12:41,691 --> 00:12:43,622
Wait till the convulsions start.

206
00:12:43,623 --> 00:12:47,155
Full body pains, leaking
from everywhere, then...

207
00:12:47,156 --> 00:12:48,940
Hypersensitivity to brightness and sound.

208
00:12:48,974 --> 00:12:50,908
After that, overwhelming paranoia

209
00:12:50,943 --> 00:12:52,977
followed by the darkest of depressions.

210
00:12:53,011 --> 00:12:55,146
Symptoms may persist for two weeks,

211
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,416
assuming I last that long.

212
00:12:58,450 --> 00:13:00,084
Yeah, I know what's in store.

213
00:13:00,119 --> 00:13:01,753
Romero may have a point.

214
00:13:01,787 --> 00:13:04,956
You're not gonna be good for
anything till you kick this.

215
00:13:06,992 --> 00:13:09,927
I... it burns.

216
00:13:11,497 --> 00:13:13,164
Don't be mad at me.

217
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:16,067
I know I slipped, but I'm
about to change the world.

218
00:13:16,901 --> 00:13:20,004
I'm about to change the world.

219
00:13:44,630 --> 00:13:46,430
Shit.

220
00:13:47,900 --> 00:13:52,470
Mm, that is the way I like
to get up in the morning.

221
00:13:52,504 --> 00:13:55,773
Screw coffee or breakfast in bed.

222
00:13:55,808 --> 00:13:57,508
The first thing I could see every day

223
00:13:57,543 --> 00:13:59,110
is that sweet butt of yours.

224
00:13:59,144 --> 00:14:02,113
I'd be the happiest dude in the city.

225
00:14:02,147 --> 00:14:04,282
Are you going somewhere, babe?

226
00:14:04,316 --> 00:14:06,851
Yeah, um, I'm gonna meet my dad for brunch.

227
00:14:06,885 --> 00:14:08,152
What? No, babe.

228
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:10,488
I was gonna take you to brunch.

229
00:14:10,522 --> 00:14:13,825
I mean, I know that things are, like, okay

230
00:14:13,859 --> 00:14:15,860
between us right now, but I'm... I'm not

231
00:14:15,894 --> 00:14:18,329
gonna let myself off easy, all right?

232
00:14:18,363 --> 00:14:21,132
You will be wined, and you will be dined

233
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,735
until I feel I've gotten
myself out of the doghouse.

234
00:14:24,770 --> 00:14:27,405
Well, we can do something tonight, then.

235
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:29,140
Perfect.

236
00:14:29,174 --> 00:14:30,842
- Okay.
- No.

237
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,214
Oh, hey.

238
00:14:36,248 --> 00:14:38,649
Is Elliot around? I tried texting him.

239
00:14:38,684 --> 00:14:40,318
Uh, he didn't text me back.

240
00:14:40,352 --> 00:14:41,652
Yeah, he's gone for the day,

241
00:14:41,687 --> 00:14:44,589
which is why I'm on Flipper duty.

242
00:14:44,623 --> 00:14:46,257
Where is he?

243
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,658
Shit if I know.

244
00:14:47,693 --> 00:14:49,360
I mean, I don't ask details,

245
00:14:49,394 --> 00:14:53,064
but he only ever tells me
what he wants anyway, right?

246
00:14:53,098 --> 00:14:55,233
And I'll tell him you stopped by.

247
00:14:59,705 --> 00:15:03,107
Do you want to walk with us?

248
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,244
Flipper loves an audience when she pees.

249
00:15:09,648 --> 00:15:12,283
Sure. Yeah. I gotta...

250
00:15:12,317 --> 00:15:14,051
head back towards the subway anyway.

251
00:15:14,086 --> 00:15:15,953
Oh, we don't plan our path.

252
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,022
I mean, we just kind of wing it

253
00:15:18,056 --> 00:15:20,591
and see where the moment takes us.

254
00:15:20,626 --> 00:15:21,959
Come on.

255
00:15:21,994 --> 00:15:24,495
Come on, before she bursts.

256
00:15:28,901 --> 00:15:31,602
Maybe this was all intentional.

257
00:15:31,637 --> 00:15:33,971
My subconscious, running in the background,

258
00:15:34,006 --> 00:15:37,475
making me doubt what I got
everyone else to believe in.

259
00:15:37,509 --> 00:15:40,144
Turning me into the physical
manifestation of my fear

260
00:15:40,178 --> 00:15:41,312
of being a...

261
00:15:41,346 --> 00:15:42,947
Goddamn waste.

262
00:15:42,981 --> 00:15:44,749
Just give him a night to recover, okay?

263
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,717
- We still have tomorrow.
- This shit'll last a week.

264
00:15:46,752 --> 00:15:48,819
And I refuse to waste
my time playing nurse.

265
00:15:48,854 --> 00:15:52,156
We gotta get back, regroup,
start devising a plan B.

266
00:15:53,992 --> 00:15:55,326
The rabbit is in the administration system.

267
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,728
- Send a flu shot.
- Rabbit, flu shot...

268
00:15:57,763 --> 00:16:00,097
- Someone talk to me.
- A rabbit replicates

269
00:16:00,132 --> 00:16:03,000
till it overloads a file,
then it spreads like cancer.

270
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:04,302
Cancer?

271
00:16:04,336 --> 00:16:05,670
Hollywood hacker bullshit.

272
00:16:05,704 --> 00:16:07,438
I been in this game 27 years.

273
00:16:07,472 --> 00:16:10,474
Not once have I ever come
across an animated singing virus.

274
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:13,911
I have yet to fly through a
Tron City directory structure.

275
00:16:13,946 --> 00:16:16,147
I bet you right now some
writer's working hard

276
00:16:16,181 --> 00:16:19,452
on a TV show that'll mess
up this generation's idea

277
00:16:19,453 --> 00:16:22,971
of hacker culture.

278
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:58,405
All you had to do is ask, klepto.

279
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,499
I've updated the FTP.

280
00:17:01,508 --> 00:17:02,676
All the files are ready.

281
00:17:02,677 --> 00:17:05,144
- I've created...
- Any word from the road?

282
00:17:06,513 --> 00:17:08,815
Jesus, it's been a full 24 hours.

283
00:17:08,849 --> 00:17:10,750
Where the hell could they be?

284
00:17:12,252 --> 00:17:14,187
Got any Advil?

285
00:17:17,424 --> 00:17:19,993
I'm guessing you didn't make contact.

286
00:17:20,027 --> 00:17:21,725
Nope.

287
00:17:21,729 --> 00:17:24,097
Perhaps this plan was
a little too ambitious.

288
00:17:24,132 --> 00:17:26,533
We'll wait until the rest of them get back

289
00:17:26,568 --> 00:17:28,101
and then reevaluate.

290
00:17:28,136 --> 00:17:30,204
Sitting here helpless
while we crash and burn?

291
00:17:30,238 --> 00:17:31,505
Not my speed.

292
00:17:31,539 --> 00:17:33,240
Even if they hack into Steel Mountain,

293
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,542
we need to hit China's
data centers simultaneously.

294
00:17:35,577 --> 00:17:37,010
If the Dark Army isn't compliant,

295
00:17:37,045 --> 00:17:39,713
then there's not much we can do.

296
00:17:41,982 --> 00:17:44,451
God... shit!

297
00:17:44,485 --> 00:17:46,553
I got so wasted, I forgot it's Sunday.

298
00:17:46,587 --> 00:17:48,121
I know where my guy will be.

299
00:17:48,155 --> 00:17:50,023
Is that wise?

300
00:17:50,057 --> 00:17:53,426
Those guys aren't known for
being the most understanding.

301
00:17:53,461 --> 00:17:54,861
I'm assuming if he wanted contact...

302
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,130
What about what I want?

303
00:17:59,266 --> 00:18:00,633
I'm coming with you.

304
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:02,235
No, thank you.

305
00:18:02,269 --> 00:18:05,071
You stick around, wait
for the boys to FTP it.

306
00:18:12,313 --> 00:18:13,913
Hey, Trenton.

307
00:18:31,632 --> 00:18:33,433
Here.

308
00:18:35,703 --> 00:18:38,338
- What is this?
- Come on, they're my last two.

309
00:18:40,474 --> 00:18:41,741
Is this ecstasy?

310
00:18:41,776 --> 00:18:43,576
No, it's clarity.

311
00:18:43,911 --> 00:18:47,180
It'll help you see past
whatever's bringing you down.

312
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:50,249
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be rude.

313
00:18:50,284 --> 00:18:52,485
I... don't do drugs.

314
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,712
- I mean, I... I smoke weed...
- Well, sorry,

315
00:18:54,713 --> 00:18:56,736
but there's no take-backs, so...

316
00:18:56,757 --> 00:18:59,125
Besides, don't you want
to figure your shit out?

317
00:19:00,962 --> 00:19:04,064
For me, sometimes when I'm
going through something,

318
00:19:04,098 --> 00:19:06,266
just gotta... I don't know.

319
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:09,436
Forget about it for a little while.

320
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:49,643
Are you seriously drinking

321
00:19:49,677 --> 00:19:51,778
a goddamn sparkling water right now?

322
00:19:51,812 --> 00:19:55,048
If you weren't wearing my
scarf, I'd kick your ass.

323
00:19:58,853 --> 00:20:00,854
I think we should go.

324
00:20:00,888 --> 00:20:04,858
Trust me... he's here every Sunday, okay?

325
00:20:04,892 --> 00:20:06,426
He'll show.

326
00:20:13,401 --> 00:20:15,235
Jesus Christ, Romero. What are we gonna do?

327
00:20:15,269 --> 00:20:17,003
We dump him at a hospital,

328
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,905
come up with an alternative
course of action.

329
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,675
- That's our only option.
- No. No hospital.

330
00:20:21,709 --> 00:20:23,543
Then we split. Screw it.

331
00:20:23,577 --> 00:20:25,345
I mean, you say it all the time yourself,

332
00:20:25,379 --> 00:20:27,080
there's casualties in every revolution.

333
00:20:27,114 --> 00:20:29,416
All that matters is the end result.

334
00:20:29,450 --> 00:20:31,084
We got no time to haul dead weight.

335
00:20:31,118 --> 00:20:33,119

Fine! You wanna leave, leave.

336
00:20:35,589 --> 00:20:37,524
Screw this, man.

337
00:20:53,774 --> 00:20:55,508
I need a hit.

338
00:20:55,543 --> 00:20:57,377
I'll be better.

339
00:20:57,411 --> 00:20:58,678
Just to get me through this.

340
00:20:58,713 --> 00:21:01,247
I can't let you do that.

341
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,217
One hit.

342
00:21:04,251 --> 00:21:06,453
You know, just to get me back on the road.

343
00:21:06,487 --> 00:21:09,422
We don't have time. This...

344
00:21:09,457 --> 00:21:11,791
needs to happen now.

345
00:21:13,828 --> 00:21:14,828
One hit.

346
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:26,728
Come on.

347
00:21:28,430 --> 00:21:30,298
Let's go.

348
00:21:33,769 --> 00:21:35,493
'Scuse me, fella.

349
00:21:35,494 --> 00:21:37,738
You lookin' for something?

350
00:21:37,739 --> 00:21:40,541
He could really use a helping hand.

351
00:21:40,576 --> 00:21:43,177
Yeah, okay, he can go in. But only him.

352
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:46,013
Uh, no can do. I gotta come with.

353
00:21:46,048 --> 00:21:49,784
Only if you're partaking,
otherwise he goes it alone.

354
00:21:53,922 --> 00:21:55,923
Here you go.

355
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,225
30.

356
00:21:57,259 --> 00:21:59,293
30.

357
00:22:01,296 --> 00:22:04,198
The guy in the house will set you up right.

358
00:22:04,233 --> 00:22:06,060
Long as he doesn't kill you.

359
00:22:10,005 --> 00:22:12,907
All right, look, the minute you're done...

360
00:22:12,941 --> 00:22:14,742
you leave.

361
00:22:14,777 --> 00:22:17,378
You don't look at anyone.
You don't talk to anyone.

362
00:22:17,412 --> 00:22:20,281
You take care of business and you get out.

363
00:22:20,315 --> 00:22:23,952
Hey. Nod if you understand.

364
00:22:54,449 --> 00:22:55,449
You want?

365
00:22:57,986 --> 00:22:59,787
Hey.

366
00:22:59,822 --> 00:23:02,190
Big eyes.

367
00:23:04,793 --> 00:23:07,128
It's all good, man. Go on.

368
00:23:07,162 --> 00:23:08,629
I just...

369
00:23:08,664 --> 00:23:10,865
I need morphine. Pills.

370
00:23:10,899 --> 00:23:12,300
No, man.

371
00:23:12,334 --> 00:23:14,936
This is all we got right here.

372
00:23:14,970 --> 00:23:17,638
It's better.

373
00:23:17,673 --> 00:23:19,807
Trust me.

374
00:23:22,978 --> 00:23:24,846
Go on.

375
00:23:24,848 --> 00:23:27,481
There you go. There you go.

376
00:23:27,516 --> 00:23:30,618
I'll help.

377
00:23:30,652 --> 00:23:34,155
It'll be okay. I'll help.

378
00:23:40,596 --> 00:23:42,864
Have I sunk this low?

379
00:23:42,898 --> 00:23:44,632
What must you think of me?

380
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:47,168
Is it spring? Election year?

381
00:23:47,202 --> 00:23:49,170
Shall I hibernate?

382
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:53,174
Did we meet? In money we trust.

383
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:57,211
No, I created... stop.

384
00:23:57,246 --> 00:24:00,381
I can't control thoughts. I need this.

385
00:24:00,415 --> 00:24:03,517
I know I promised my last line, but...

386
00:24:16,531 --> 00:24:19,767
Greedy bitch!

387
00:24:30,245 --> 00:24:31,879
Aah!

388
00:24:31,914 --> 00:24:34,548
Shit, man...

389
00:24:38,887 --> 00:24:40,254
Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,

390
00:24:40,289 --> 00:24:43,357
here's that seven-day forecast
for the tri-state area.

391
00:24:43,392 --> 00:24:45,359
Lots of clouds today, but mostly sunny

392
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:46,727
through Thursday with temperatures

393
00:24:46,762 --> 00:24:48,496
in the mid to the upper 80s.

394
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:49,997
And you will notice that the humidity

395
00:24:50,032 --> 00:24:51,232
will be a tad uncomfortable.

396
00:24:52,901 --> 00:24:54,835
Dear brothers and sisters,

397
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,938
now is the time to open your eyes.

398
00:24:56,972 --> 00:24:59,573
If you have not yet woken up to the reality

399
00:24:59,608 --> 00:25:02,443
of profiteering and enslavement
we've been warning you about,

400
00:25:02,477 --> 00:25:05,613
I hope you realize we are
fast running out of time.

401
00:25:05,647 --> 00:25:08,616
The governments of the world
and their corporate masters

402
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:10,451
do not want us to speak.

403
00:25:10,485 --> 00:25:13,120
Why? Because we unlock truths.

404
00:25:13,155 --> 00:25:16,223
We expose villains. We exorcize demons.

405
00:25:16,258 --> 00:25:18,592
Citizens of the world, we are here to help.

406
00:25:18,627 --> 00:25:21,562
If you have any interest
in waking from your slumber,

407
00:25:21,596 --> 00:25:24,565
in retrieving lost,
damaged, or stolen memory,

408
00:25:24,599 --> 00:25:26,434
we are here for you.

409
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,236
We have your back. We are FSociety.

410
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:00,801
What's it open?

411
00:26:03,672 --> 00:26:05,840
It belongs to you now.

412
00:26:05,874 --> 00:26:07,942
Made in the Orient.

413
00:26:07,976 --> 00:26:10,478
Made just for your head.

414
00:26:15,484 --> 00:26:18,652
Now, find your monster, then turn the key.

415
00:26:18,687 --> 00:26:20,187
But first...

416
00:26:20,222 --> 00:26:22,656
a word from our corporate overlords!

417
00:26:24,287 --> 00:26:27,222
If you see our logo, that
means you can rest assured

418
00:26:27,256 --> 00:26:28,840
that you're buying the best food,

419
00:26:28,841 --> 00:26:30,191
clothing, shelter,

420
00:26:30,226 --> 00:26:32,724
transportation, hygiene, electronics,

421
00:26:32,761 --> 00:26:35,062
and life's necessities that money can buy.

422
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:25,879
Hello.

423
00:27:25,913 --> 00:27:27,747
Hello, friend.

424
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:31,418
But we're not friends.

425
00:27:33,421 --> 00:27:37,357
Can you tell me what
happened to that house?

426
00:27:39,427 --> 00:27:41,761
First can you tell me? What's your monster?

427
00:27:48,236 --> 00:27:50,871
I think you dropped this.

428
00:28:06,821 --> 00:28:08,688
* Ding dong ding *

429
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:11,658
* Ding dong ding *

430
00:28:20,568 --> 00:28:23,603
Don't be shy now.

431
00:28:23,638 --> 00:28:26,973
You can come closer.

432
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:35,248
Unsettling, I know.

433
00:28:35,283 --> 00:28:38,084
Your pet beta fish chatting you up.

434
00:28:38,119 --> 00:28:40,754
But time's money, Elliot.

435
00:28:40,788 --> 00:28:43,456
You need something?

436
00:28:43,491 --> 00:28:45,759
Your water... does it need changing?

437
00:28:45,793 --> 00:28:49,729
When you live in a fishbowl,
ain't no such thing as change.

438
00:28:49,764 --> 00:28:52,165
My entire life's been spent in this thing.

439
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,768
My whole world's on your side table.

440
00:28:54,802 --> 00:28:58,572
I look around... same shit, different day.

441
00:28:58,606 --> 00:29:00,173
The lighting, the furniture.

442
00:29:00,208 --> 00:29:02,676
Even the sounds... always the same.

443
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,110
I'm on a loop,

444
00:29:04,145 --> 00:29:06,746
and it won't stop unless my life does.

445
00:29:06,781 --> 00:29:10,650
I'm exhausted with this world.

446
00:29:10,685 --> 00:29:12,852
What can I do? I wanna help.

447
00:29:12,887 --> 00:29:14,821
I think it's pretty obvious.

448
00:29:14,855 --> 00:29:17,157
There's really only one thing you can do

449
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:19,759
for a brother in a fishbowl.

450
00:29:19,794 --> 00:29:20,994
What is it?

451
00:29:21,028 --> 00:29:25,365
Move him to a goddamn window!

452
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:42,649
Angela, he's my friend.

453
00:29:42,683 --> 00:29:44,851
Yes.

454
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:47,554
And he's delicious.

455
00:29:49,824 --> 00:29:51,358
Here.

456
00:30:00,168 --> 00:30:01,435
- Eat this.
- Mm-mm.

457
00:30:01,569 --> 00:30:02,703
Open.

458
00:30:13,948 --> 00:30:17,384
It's piping hot, so consume with caution.

459
00:30:17,418 --> 00:30:19,419
Pop's famous raspberry pie.

460
00:30:19,453 --> 00:30:20,787
Enjoy.

461
00:30:33,067 --> 00:30:34,267
Mm...

462
00:30:39,273 --> 00:30:40,907
Yes.

463
00:30:40,941 --> 00:30:42,509
Yes!

464
00:30:42,543 --> 00:30:45,578
Yes, Elliot, I do.

465
00:30:47,915 --> 00:30:49,916
Elliot, I do!

466
00:30:49,950 --> 00:30:52,519
I do!

467
00:31:41,269 --> 00:31:43,781
Those people in there...

468
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,608
I just told them what they wanted to hear.

469
00:31:52,346 --> 00:31:54,714
You're not gonna do it, are you?

470
00:31:56,650 --> 00:31:59,486
Change the world.

471
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,756
Figures. You were only born a month ago.

472
00:32:04,458 --> 00:32:08,261
You're afraid.

473
00:32:08,295 --> 00:32:10,997
Afraid of your monster.

474
00:32:11,031 --> 00:32:13,166
Do you even know what it is?

475
00:32:18,139 --> 00:32:21,141
It doesn't fit.

476
00:32:26,247 --> 00:32:29,449
Why not?

477
00:32:29,483 --> 00:32:31,418
Isn't it obvious?

478
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:36,289
You're not Elliot.

479
00:32:36,323 --> 00:32:37,290
You're the...

480
00:32:42,029 --> 00:32:44,397
Hello?

481
00:32:45,499 --> 00:32:46,699
Hello?

482
00:33:06,954 --> 00:33:08,922
Am I still alone?

483
00:33:08,956 --> 00:33:11,491
Is this the face of my only friend?

484
00:33:11,525 --> 00:33:13,293
Are you my monster?

485
00:33:16,797 --> 00:33:20,266
I am here. You are alone.

486
00:33:33,481 --> 00:33:36,716
They all left.

487
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:38,952
They all left.

488
00:33:41,622 --> 00:33:43,790
They all left.

489
00:33:46,093 --> 00:33:48,061
I'm alone.

490
00:33:51,065 --> 00:33:52,532
I'm alone.

491
00:33:54,335 --> 00:33:56,903
I'm alone.

492
00:33:57,437 --> 00:33:59,338
No, you're not.

493
00:34:05,746 --> 00:34:08,335
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

494
00:34:08,736 --> 00:34:11,951
We're in this to the end.

495
00:34:23,323 --> 00:34:25,417
Maybe you should just walk. Ballet seems

496
00:34:25,418 --> 00:34:26,825
out of your skill set.

497
00:34:26,826 --> 00:34:29,055
What? Screw you, young'un!

498
00:34:29,056 --> 00:34:31,329
This bitch can plié with the best of 'em.

499
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,664
You know, when I'm not
bangin' on a keyboard,

500
00:34:33,699 --> 00:34:36,033
I'm schooling classmates
with moves like this!

501
00:34:38,337 --> 00:34:39,603
Ooh!

502
00:34:39,638 --> 00:34:41,739
Good lookin' out.

503
00:34:53,552 --> 00:34:55,986
I'm sorry he never came.

504
00:35:00,692 --> 00:35:02,159
Let's... let's just go.

505
00:35:02,594 --> 00:35:06,497
I am a menace to society!

506
00:35:10,568 --> 00:35:12,269
What?

507
00:35:12,303 --> 00:35:14,471
- Wait, where are you going?
- It's him.

508
00:35:51,543 --> 00:35:53,977
Phone. Now!

509
00:35:54,012 --> 00:35:55,979
Come on.

510
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:24,440
Why am I still out?

511
00:36:24,474 --> 00:36:25,942
I have to be at work

512
00:36:25,976 --> 00:36:28,511
in four hours!

513
00:36:28,545 --> 00:36:32,515
There's a lot I'm gonna
miss about this gig.

514
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:35,551
What are you gonna do for money now?

515
00:36:35,585 --> 00:36:38,788
Oh, you know. Just be a hottie waitress.

516
00:36:38,822 --> 00:36:41,057
I'm, uh... Oh, thank you.

517
00:36:41,091 --> 00:36:42,491
Glad you liked it.

518
00:36:42,526 --> 00:36:43,993
Thanks.

519
00:36:44,027 --> 00:36:46,395
Although I am glad I got in one last hurrah

520
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,964
before going all corporate.

521
00:36:49,499 --> 00:36:50,666
You're not worried?

522
00:36:50,701 --> 00:36:53,169
Worried about what?

523
00:36:53,203 --> 00:36:54,704
I don't know.

524
00:36:54,738 --> 00:36:57,406
I always get worried
before starting a new job.

525
00:36:57,441 --> 00:37:01,143
No. I am definitely not worried.

526
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,912
Worry's a waste of time.

527
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:06,045
I mean, shit didn't work out
at one job, so I got another.

528
00:37:06,080 --> 00:37:07,480
That's all!

529
00:37:09,383 --> 00:37:10,984
You worry a lot, don't you?

530
00:37:14,889 --> 00:37:15,825
Yeah.

531
00:37:41,349 --> 00:37:43,350
Look in the mirror.

532
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:49,990
See that badass bitch?

533
00:37:52,193 --> 00:37:55,696
That's the only person you
should ever worry about.

534
00:38:27,094 --> 00:38:29,580
Do you know how hard it's
been for me to find you?

535
00:38:33,601 --> 00:38:35,301
Come here.

536
00:38:35,336 --> 00:38:37,804
Yo, you need to chill.

537
00:38:37,838 --> 00:38:40,306
Go to hell, asshole!

538
00:38:41,375 --> 00:38:43,443
There she is.

539
00:38:43,477 --> 00:38:46,646
A ray of sunshine in the
dark void of my existence.

540
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,348
Oh, poetic.

541
00:38:48,382 --> 00:38:49,749
But not an apology.

542
00:38:49,783 --> 00:38:52,485
I ain't apologizing for shit.

543
00:38:52,520 --> 00:38:54,687
Oh, this is because I dumped your ass.

544
00:38:54,722 --> 00:38:57,324
For real? You're gonna
start pissing me off.

545
00:38:57,426 --> 00:38:58,911
Sorry I wanted to spend my life with you.

546
00:38:58,912 --> 00:38:59,993
What a monster I am.

547
00:39:00,228 --> 00:39:02,562
Things are happening, Cisco.

548
00:39:02,597 --> 00:39:04,631
We need to go tomorrow.

549
00:39:04,665 --> 00:39:05,799
It's our only shot.

550
00:39:05,833 --> 00:39:08,168
Then you never had one.

551
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,237
Look, I'm serious, Darlene.

552
00:39:10,271 --> 00:39:12,172
These guys don't mess around.

553
00:39:12,206 --> 00:39:14,007
Now, whatever it is you
think you're doing...

554
00:39:14,041 --> 00:39:15,508
freeing the world, freeing the masses...

555
00:39:15,543 --> 00:39:17,010
the guys I work for,

556
00:39:17,044 --> 00:39:19,212
they ain't motivated by
kumbaya shit like that.

557
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:22,148
All right? Now, I'm warning you...

558
00:39:22,183 --> 00:39:23,950
for the last time.

559
00:39:28,789 --> 00:39:31,024
Oh, come on.

560
00:39:48,576 --> 00:39:53,013
You know how much this means to me.

561
00:39:53,047 --> 00:39:55,915
Please...

562
00:39:55,950 --> 00:39:58,451
just talk to them.

563
00:40:05,159 --> 00:40:08,528
My Aunt Esther cured all
her habits with this...

564
00:40:08,562 --> 00:40:11,531
liquid anti-diarrheal
for the... well, you know.

565
00:40:11,565 --> 00:40:14,367
Lemon and salt for the electrolytes,

566
00:40:14,402 --> 00:40:16,536
decongestant for the runny nose.

567
00:40:16,570 --> 00:40:18,371
This is the third one.

568
00:40:18,406 --> 00:40:20,106
Seven more, you'll be good as new.

569
00:40:26,614 --> 00:40:28,548
I'ma go pull the van around.

570
00:40:28,582 --> 00:40:30,417
Make sure he keeps chugging those.

571
00:40:31,786 --> 00:40:33,920
Thanks.

572
00:40:35,256 --> 00:40:36,289
Cool.

573
00:40:38,292 --> 00:40:39,659
Hello again.

574
00:40:39,694 --> 00:40:41,494
Long time no...

575
00:40:41,529 --> 00:40:43,763
whatever it is we do.

576
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:46,800
I missed you. Where did you go?

577
00:40:46,834 --> 00:40:49,436
Did you leave, or did I?

578
00:40:59,814 --> 00:41:01,481
Maybe it was both.

579
00:41:01,515 --> 00:41:04,751
Or neither. Doesn't matter.

580
00:41:21,068 --> 00:41:24,003
Do those hopeful moments scare me?

581
00:41:24,038 --> 00:41:27,207
Of course. Daemons, remember?

582
00:41:34,014 --> 00:41:37,050
At some point an "action
without user interaction"

583
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:40,453
will come along and sweep my legs.

584
00:41:40,488 --> 00:41:43,223
This spinning wheel of
false highs and true lows

585
00:41:43,257 --> 00:41:45,058
will continue.

586
00:41:45,092 --> 00:41:46,693
That much I know.

587
00:43:49,479 --> 00:43:52,181
Daemons... they don't stop working.

588
00:43:52,215 --> 00:43:53,682
They're always active.

589
00:43:57,021 --> 00:43:59,756
They seduce. They manipulate.

590
00:43:59,790 --> 00:44:01,891
They own us.

591
00:44:05,630 --> 00:44:08,031
And even though you're with me,

592
00:44:08,065 --> 00:44:11,201
even though I created you,
it makes no difference.

593
00:44:11,235 --> 00:44:12,936
We all must deal with them alone.

594
00:44:12,970 --> 00:44:15,005
The best we can hope for...

595
00:44:15,039 --> 00:44:17,540
the only silver lining in all of this...

596
00:44:17,575 --> 00:44:19,376
is that when we break through,

597
00:44:19,610 --> 00:44:22,212
we find a few familiar faces

598
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:25,448
waiting on the other side.
