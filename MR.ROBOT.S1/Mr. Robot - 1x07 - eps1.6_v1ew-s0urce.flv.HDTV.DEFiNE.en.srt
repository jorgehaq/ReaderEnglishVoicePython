1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:03,570
So, what do we got?

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:06,213
Terry Colby was involved in the cover-up

3
00:00:06,214 --> 00:00:08,788
of the Washington Township
toxic waste scandal.

4
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:11,174
What do we need to prove our case?

5
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:14,010
Someone who was there
when the decision was made

6
00:00:14,045 --> 00:00:16,346
to falsify chemical waste intel.

7
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:18,848
Get the hell away from my
home. Get away from my home!

8
00:00:18,884 --> 00:00:21,217
Elliot, what is going on with you?

9
00:00:21,269 --> 00:00:23,803
I cannot help you if
you keep me in the dark.

10
00:00:23,855 --> 00:00:25,054
We got problems.

11
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,890
The Dark Army is bailing.

12
00:00:26,942 --> 00:00:28,191
It's not over.

13
00:00:28,226 --> 00:00:30,226
We'll find a way, just not tonight.

14
00:00:30,228 --> 00:00:33,229
How do you not blow your
brains out married to him?

15
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:34,731
You want to watch me piss too?

16
00:00:34,783 --> 00:00:38,067
- Scott, a misunderstanding...
- Happy to pull my dick out for you.

17
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:39,819
Elliot!

18
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:43,740
- Where is she?
- I told you you'd get her back, bro.

19
00:01:50,525 --> 00:01:52,025
Shit!

20
00:02:03,872 --> 00:02:05,788
Shit!

21
00:02:09,494 --> 00:02:11,160
Open up!

22
00:02:11,213 --> 00:02:12,996
I'm bleeding all over the hallway!

23
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:17,834
It's a life-or-death
situation out here!

24
00:02:17,886 --> 00:02:20,253
Look, I know you're in
there. I just saw you go in.

25
00:02:20,305 --> 00:02:23,506
Open up!

26
00:02:23,558 --> 00:02:25,675
I'm looking...

27
00:02:27,178 --> 00:02:29,512
Well, are you just gonna stand there?

28
00:02:29,564 --> 00:02:31,981
Get me a glass of water, dummy.

29
00:02:32,017 --> 00:02:34,484
Can I use this? Thanks.

30
00:02:36,738 --> 00:02:38,521
My niece gave him to me.

31
00:02:38,573 --> 00:02:41,524
I haven't even named him yet. God.

32
00:02:41,576 --> 00:02:43,826
Do you know the pressure
of an ecstatic six-year-old?

33
00:02:43,862 --> 00:02:47,830
I mean, I kill that thing,
and her whole world collapses.

34
00:02:47,866 --> 00:02:50,617
I like what you did with the place.

35
00:02:50,669 --> 00:02:52,702
Hmm.

36
00:02:52,704 --> 00:02:55,705
Yeah, nice setup. Still
like mine better though.

37
00:03:08,436 --> 00:03:12,388
Yo, let me know if you
want a top-shelf hookup.

38
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,974
Actually, now that I have you...

39
00:03:15,026 --> 00:03:19,562
will you help me move
a dresser... Mr. Muscles?

40
00:03:19,564 --> 00:03:22,565
Okay, come on. Just come on.

41
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:36,329
Man 'N' Van is getting way too legit.

42
00:03:36,381 --> 00:03:37,747
They used to just be, like, drummers

43
00:03:37,749 --> 00:03:39,248
with their mom's Honda Odysseys.

44
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,584
Now it's an actual company in Queens.

45
00:03:41,586 --> 00:03:45,171
I mean, the guys are literally men in vans.

46
00:03:45,223 --> 00:03:46,589
I'd buy morphine from you,

47
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:51,594
if you could also get me Suboxone.

48
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:55,598
Well, it's pretty much
impossible to get Suboxone.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,433
My supplier doesn't have it.

50
00:04:02,407 --> 00:04:05,441
I saw this song live once. It was so rad.

51
00:04:05,443 --> 00:04:08,027
Don't you just love hearing
your favorite songs in person,

52
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:10,530
like, half deaf from the speakers,

53
00:04:10,582 --> 00:04:15,084
- everyone going nuts around you?
- No.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,122
Direct. I respect that.

55
00:04:19,174 --> 00:04:22,959
I just hate concerts.

56
00:04:22,961 --> 00:04:24,794
Lots of people.

57
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:33,970
- You don't like people, huh?
- Not most of them, no.

58
00:04:36,107 --> 00:04:37,473
Okay.

59
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:39,976
Well, so by that rationale, if you were

60
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:42,311
to really like one person, it'd be, like,

61
00:04:42,313 --> 00:04:47,116
considered an aberration or an abnormality

62
00:04:47,152 --> 00:04:51,621
- or special, even.
- I guess.

63
00:04:52,404 --> 00:04:54,824
Well, I aim for special,

64
00:04:54,876 --> 00:04:58,077
so challenge accepted.

65
00:05:04,169 --> 00:05:09,338
I wish we already knew each other.

66
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:13,509
Would make this feel less awkward.

67
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:19,677
- You really feel awkward right now?
- Yeah.

68
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:25,521
Well, then I wish we
knew each other too then.

69
00:05:30,493 --> 00:05:31,694
Oh, yikes.

70
00:05:31,746 --> 00:05:36,449
I, um, I'm late. Meeting
the girls for drinks.

71
00:05:36,501 --> 00:05:38,701
Oh, um, I'm Shayla.

72
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,540
Elliot.

73
00:05:48,913 --> 00:05:51,909
You know, I do know of
a guy who sells Suboxone.

74
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:53,466
He's supposed to be
a fucking psychopath,

75
00:05:53,518 --> 00:05:54,801
but if you want, I can call him.

76
00:05:55,293 --> 00:05:57,250
You might be worth a psychopath.

77
00:05:57,251 --> 00:05:59,522
I don't know. Maybe.

78
00:05:59,557 --> 00:06:02,308
Oh, and keep the fish, you filthy animal.

79
00:06:11,693 --> 00:06:16,525
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

80
00:06:24,582 --> 00:06:27,350
Sorry I
haven't talked to you in a while.

81
00:06:27,385 --> 00:06:30,019
I mean, it's only been
a month, which I guess

82
00:06:30,054 --> 00:06:33,589
in the grand scheme of
things isn't that long.

83
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:35,258
Isn't our life like a blip

84
00:06:35,310 --> 00:06:39,929
in the cosmic calender or something?

85
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:42,231
So that's Shayla.

86
00:06:42,267 --> 00:06:44,066
A blip.

87
00:06:44,102 --> 00:06:45,685
Not even.

88
00:06:45,737 --> 00:06:48,104
Here one blip, gone the next.

89
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:51,190
Makes me hate myself that
I've already gotten used to

90
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:53,442
the idea of her not being here.

91
00:06:53,495 --> 00:06:55,444
In a year, I'll maybe think about her

92
00:06:55,497 --> 00:06:57,246
every once in a while.

93
00:06:57,282 --> 00:07:00,783
Then she'll become an
anecdote, a thing to say.

94
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:03,452
"I knew a girl that died,"

95
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:07,623
with the added bonus of,
"She died because of me."

96
00:07:07,675 --> 00:07:12,929
- Maybe I should hate myself.
- Here are the last two forms.

97
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:14,597
She's getting rid of me,

98
00:07:14,632 --> 00:07:16,883
in case you're still
trying to figure that out.

99
00:07:16,935 --> 00:07:18,935
- Once I...
- Sign on the bottom.

100
00:07:23,474 --> 00:07:24,974
Then I'll deliver it to the court,

101
00:07:25,026 --> 00:07:26,392
and in two weeks' time, you'll receive

102
00:07:26,444 --> 00:07:29,145
an official release from the mandate.

103
00:07:29,147 --> 00:07:30,813
That second form means
that we've been sitting

104
00:07:30,865 --> 00:07:33,733
- in this room for a year.
- Over 52 hours

105
00:07:33,785 --> 00:07:36,152
of Krista's voice
bouncing around this room.

106
00:07:36,204 --> 00:07:39,822
She thinks she's a
wasted echo. Maybe she is.

107
00:07:39,874 --> 00:07:41,657
I wonder how much time I've spent

108
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,660
- not listening to her in here.
- I'm worried about you, Elliot.

109
00:07:44,712 --> 00:07:46,418
I really want you to keep coming here.

110
00:07:46,419 --> 00:07:47,663
We've got a lot more work to do.

111
00:07:47,665 --> 00:07:49,165
She wants more from me

112
00:07:49,167 --> 00:07:50,800
but she doesn't believe in me.

113
00:07:50,835 --> 00:07:53,336
I tried because I believe
some part inside of you

114
00:07:53,338 --> 00:07:57,640
- wants to do this right.
- You?

115
00:07:57,675 --> 00:08:00,009
Are you on her side?

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,667
You should clean your sockets.

117
00:08:37,048 --> 00:08:40,483
Sounds too good to be true, but I'll bite.

118
00:08:40,519 --> 00:08:43,520
- What's the ask?
- Given my client has information

119
00:08:43,555 --> 00:08:45,255
that could help your client's case,

120
00:08:45,290 --> 00:08:48,925
we want the meeting restricted
to her, Colby, and myself,

121
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:53,230
- and we want it conducted off-record.
- Antara, come on.

122
00:08:53,911 --> 00:08:58,374
- My client won't accept your presence.
- Our client pays for ours.

123
00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:00,403
Then you're duty-bound to present him

124
00:09:00,455 --> 00:09:03,340
with any legitimate offer
of beneficial evidence.

125
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,175
Of course.

126
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:09,879
Give us something truly
legitimate and beneficial.

127
00:09:09,915 --> 00:09:12,549
You won't even tell us what
the hell your client has.

128
00:09:12,584 --> 00:09:15,585
Seth, we've been sitting on opposite sides

129
00:09:15,621 --> 00:09:17,787
of the negotiating table for two decades.

130
00:09:17,823 --> 00:09:19,689
I'm not some joker come out of the woodwork

131
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,524
trying to scam Colby for millions.

132
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:23,727
I'm giving him the only
glimmer of hope he's had.

133
00:09:26,598 --> 00:09:30,066
We'll pass along your
offer. Thanks for your time.

134
00:09:47,286 --> 00:09:50,170
Lloyd said you wanted to see me.

135
00:09:54,676 --> 00:09:58,128
Look, I appreciate your
commitment to this job.

136
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,464
I really do.

137
00:10:01,466 --> 00:10:04,301
But I don't see how you've plowed through

138
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:08,888
these last few weeks, so I
want to offer you some time off.

139
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:10,640
- Just some time to...
- I don't need time off.

140
00:10:10,692 --> 00:10:13,810
I'm good.

141
00:10:16,982 --> 00:10:20,533
Uh... uh, one more thing.

142
00:10:22,242 --> 00:10:23,959
Look,

143
00:10:25,957 --> 00:10:28,825
I'm so sorry she was taken away, Elliot,

144
00:10:28,827 --> 00:10:34,331
but don't let her death
close you off entirely.

145
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:35,999
Find someone you can be

146
00:10:36,051 --> 00:10:40,804
your honest self with, okay?

147
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:43,340
I remember when
I was a kid, I got into web design

148
00:10:43,342 --> 00:10:45,175
by ripping off sites I liked.

149
00:10:45,177 --> 00:10:47,761
All you had to do was
view source on your browser

150
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:50,180
and there it was, the code.

151
00:10:50,232 --> 00:10:53,600
You could copy-paste
it, modify it a little,

152
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:59,522
put your name on it, and
like that, it was your site.

153
00:10:59,574 --> 00:11:01,358
View source.

154
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:04,361
What if we had that for people?

155
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:06,529
Would people really want to see?

156
00:11:09,534 --> 00:11:11,815

_

161
00:11:18,481 --> 00:11:22,345
Find someone to be your honest self with?

162
00:11:22,381 --> 00:11:23,797
Bullshit.

163
00:11:27,386 --> 00:11:30,387
Really good advice. Thanks.

164
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:37,811
I quote, "The U.S.
contingent of the hacker group Fsociety

Dude, I've been trying.

How many times do you want me to hack him?

175
00:12:06,925 --> 00:12:09,342
Do you know how hard hacking a hacker is?

176
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:13,596
- Cisco switches OSes, like, all the time.
- Darlene, we need one meeting.

00:12:13,648 --> 00:12:16,182
Yeah, well, I've been using Cisco's handle

178
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,852
to send requests for the past month.

179
00:12:18,904 --> 00:12:20,937
I got nothing.

180
00:12:20,989 --> 00:12:23,356
He's slower than me, but not by much.

181
00:12:23,408 --> 00:12:25,608
If we can talk to
whiterose directly...

182
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:28,278
Whiterose? Whiterose?

183
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,080
Really?

184
00:12:31,116 --> 00:12:34,751
Okay, if the guy even exists,

185
00:12:34,786 --> 00:12:40,707
and that's a big if, no way
he's meeting you face-to-face.

186
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:42,792
For all we know...

187
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:44,878
this dude's whiterose.

188
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:47,931
Excuse me!

189
00:12:47,966 --> 00:12:49,849
Are you whiterose?

190
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:56,105
A likely story.

191
00:12:56,141 --> 00:12:59,142
'Sides, the tape backups already shipped

192
00:12:59,144 --> 00:13:01,394
to all the new Steel Mountain facilities,

193
00:13:01,446 --> 00:13:05,482
and we still haven't
found a way around that.

194
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:10,987
- I got a plan in motion.
- And God's laughing.

195
00:13:32,573 --> 00:13:35,357
This
is all I have left of her.

196
00:13:41,065 --> 00:13:43,732
I will miss her.

197
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:53,625
I need to wipe again.

198
00:14:17,101 --> 00:14:19,484
So if you scroll to the next page,

199
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,320
you'll see the summary of capital budgets

200
00:14:21,355 --> 00:14:25,214
- or purchasing and operations.
- We get it. The goddamn earning reports

201
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,777
- are gonna look good come Monday.
- Our aim is to facilitate bill payment

202
00:14:28,829 --> 00:14:30,829
and heighten financial security,

203
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:32,581
so that's an extra 2%.

204
00:14:32,616 --> 00:14:33,949
You know, if we hadn't
turned our profits around,

205
00:14:33,951 --> 00:14:36,118
- I was gonna leave.
- No way.

206
00:14:36,170 --> 00:14:38,086
Where? Don't tell me Apple.

207
00:14:38,122 --> 00:14:40,455
- Google.
- Don't buy it.

208
00:14:40,507 --> 00:14:42,257
I got a blow job from the hiring executive

209
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:44,126
on the Googleplex volleyball court.

210
00:14:44,178 --> 00:14:45,794
Oh, she was hot.

211
00:14:45,846 --> 00:14:50,933
Had a Marissa Mayer thing going on too.

212
00:14:50,968 --> 00:14:52,851
Hot execs started as hot assistants

213
00:14:52,886 --> 00:14:54,303
who fucked their way to the top

214
00:14:54,305 --> 00:14:56,271
twice as fast as the rest of us.

215
00:14:56,307 --> 00:14:58,473
You know something screwed up?

216
00:14:58,525 --> 00:15:00,976
I heard that, some
assistants, they're going gay

217
00:15:01,028 --> 00:15:04,112
- to move up the ladder.
- I'll do you one better.

218
00:15:04,148 --> 00:15:05,697
There's a special handful

219
00:15:05,733 --> 00:15:09,034
of pathetically desperate
execs going cock jockey.

220
00:15:09,069 --> 00:15:11,620
No. Oh, my God!

221
00:15:11,655 --> 00:15:14,323
Hey, Dwight, I meant to
ask. How are your children?

222
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:16,541
Hell if I know. Sent 'em off to Lawrence.

223
00:15:16,577 --> 00:15:18,293
I think Julia likes art.

224
00:15:18,329 --> 00:15:22,047
- Oh, well. Can't win 'em all.
- Lawrence?

225
00:15:22,082 --> 00:15:23,465
You'll never be able

226
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:25,634
to afford that tuition on unemployment.

227
00:15:25,669 --> 00:15:28,670
- Sorry?
- You're fired!

228
00:15:47,107 --> 00:15:49,358
You two as well.

229
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:52,361
I'm making sure you all receive
the minimum severance packages.

230
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:57,332
Mr. Wellick, I don't understand.

231
00:15:57,368 --> 00:15:59,034
What did we do?

232
00:16:05,926 --> 00:16:10,379
Nothing.

233
00:16:10,381 --> 00:16:13,348
- After...
- You said you would update me.

234
00:16:13,384 --> 00:16:15,217
I needed to discuss our situation

235
00:16:15,219 --> 00:16:17,386
with the state's attorney.

236
00:16:17,438 --> 00:16:22,724
- Thanks for coming in, Roy.
- Yeah.

237
00:16:25,112 --> 00:16:28,730
I think you should have a seat.

238
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:35,620
Colby's lawyers called 30 minutes ago.

239
00:16:35,656 --> 00:16:38,573
They wanted a promise of total
immunity before the meeting,

240
00:16:38,575 --> 00:16:41,126
which I obtained from the man you just met.

241
00:16:41,161 --> 00:16:45,213
So, yes, Colby agreed...

242
00:16:45,249 --> 00:16:48,467
with a caveat.

243
00:16:48,502 --> 00:16:51,636
I can't be in the room.
You have to go in alone.

244
00:16:56,643 --> 00:17:01,263
Look, you made a ballsy move...

245
00:17:01,265 --> 00:17:03,732
but you doing what
you're about to do...

246
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,767
entering the home of a very powerful man

247
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:08,570
with a lot at stake and
asking him for something...

248
00:17:08,605 --> 00:17:12,491
that's always a dangerous proposition.

249
00:17:12,526 --> 00:17:16,111
So one last time...

250
00:17:16,163 --> 00:17:18,113
are you sure you want to do this?

251
00:17:34,298 --> 00:17:36,598
Shit, man.

252
00:17:36,633 --> 00:17:38,183
Thought you was one of them high schoolers

253
00:17:38,218 --> 00:17:40,185
stole my mom's chaise lounge.

254
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:42,471
As heartbreaking as it is to hear that,

255
00:17:42,523 --> 00:17:43,638
you're gonna have to put that off.

256
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:45,307
Getting everybody back together.

257
00:17:45,309 --> 00:17:46,808
- Come on.
- No, man, not this time.

258
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:49,144
I'm out.

259
00:17:49,196 --> 00:17:51,196
You can't be out. We need you.

260
00:17:51,231 --> 00:17:54,149
Look, man, I got a new set of
people depending on me, okay?

261
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,984
Clients out the wazoo.

262
00:17:56,036 --> 00:17:57,702
So, you know, I mean, good luck,

263
00:17:57,738 --> 00:18:00,622
and tell the kids I said hi.

264
00:18:00,657 --> 00:18:04,826
- What is this? What are you doing here?
- Well, I figured out how to insert

265
00:18:04,828 --> 00:18:07,996
THC's genetic information
code into yeast cells.

266
00:18:08,048 --> 00:18:09,998
Tripled my earning speed.

267
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,001
Plants need weeks to
develop. Microbes need days.

268
00:18:13,053 --> 00:18:16,004
So, what, you got a Bath and Body Works

269
00:18:16,006 --> 00:18:21,675
- bottling facility in your backyard?
- Try it.

270
00:18:21,728 --> 00:18:24,146
The THC level is borderline in that blend,

271
00:18:24,181 --> 00:18:27,516
and the lavender doesn't
mess with the high.

272
00:18:27,568 --> 00:18:29,518
You just smooth it on your skin.

273
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:32,687
So you're rejecting a revolution
in favor of aroma profiles?

274
00:18:32,739 --> 00:18:34,689
What a waste of potential.

275
00:18:34,691 --> 00:18:36,858
Look, man, I know I got a good brain.

276
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,028
Besides...

277
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:43,365
what was our little
project in the end, anyway?

278
00:18:43,417 --> 00:18:47,002
Wasted shit, if you ask me.

279
00:18:47,037 --> 00:18:49,337
Well, now you're borderline pissing me off.

280
00:18:49,373 --> 00:18:53,708
Is that a fact?

281
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:55,377
And what exactly are you gonna do

282
00:18:55,429 --> 00:19:01,884
- if I decide to cross that border?
- Look at my face, Romero.

283
00:19:01,935 --> 00:19:04,219
You and I both know I'm crazy.

284
00:19:04,221 --> 00:19:05,887
Not the cute kind either.

285
00:19:05,889 --> 00:19:08,974
I'm talking crazy crazy!

286
00:19:12,896 --> 00:19:14,946
You lost touch.

287
00:19:14,982 --> 00:19:16,398
You forgot the feeling of spilling blood

288
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,734
on the battlefield by winning the fight.

289
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:22,404
I didn't want to hurt you, Romero.

290
00:19:22,406 --> 00:19:24,372
I love you, man.

291
00:19:24,408 --> 00:19:26,408
I just wanted you to come
back to the arcade with me

292
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:29,911
so we could change the world together.

293
00:19:29,913 --> 00:19:34,249
I am clearly too crazy
for you to say no to.

294
00:19:34,301 --> 00:19:35,383
Bang!

295
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:46,928
- Look on your face is priceless!
- Goddamn lunatic.

296
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:48,763
You gave me your word
when we started this thing

297
00:19:48,815 --> 00:19:50,265
that you'd finish it.

298
00:19:50,317 --> 00:19:53,401
I gave you my word what
I'd do if you didn't.

299
00:19:53,437 --> 00:19:55,153
See you back at the arcade.

300
00:20:12,349 --> 00:20:15,017
Good. I see the girl got you tea.

301
00:20:19,224 --> 00:20:20,973
Well, let's get started.

302
00:20:27,732 --> 00:20:30,766
How much do you want?

303
00:20:33,071 --> 00:20:36,439
Write your number.

304
00:20:36,491 --> 00:20:39,108
You can ask me anything you want,

305
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:41,410
but I promise you, at the end of the day,

306
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:44,447
money will always be better
than what you're looking for.

307
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,287
Mr. Colby, did you attend

308
00:20:51,339 --> 00:20:54,790
the executive board meetings during 1993?

309
00:20:58,596 --> 00:21:01,464
Were you in the room
when the decision was made

310
00:21:01,516 --> 00:21:03,549
to ignore the treatment of hazardous waste

311
00:21:03,601 --> 00:21:05,518
in Washington Township?

312
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:15,311
I have information which can help you...

313
00:21:15,363 --> 00:21:20,066
if you answer my question.

314
00:21:20,118 --> 00:21:24,153
I don't know what you're talking about.

315
00:21:24,205 --> 00:21:27,156
If you agree to testify
against the executives

316
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:31,661
who covered up the illegal
dumping of epoxy resin waste,

317
00:21:31,713 --> 00:21:33,663
I will testify that I
broke chain of custody

318
00:21:33,715 --> 00:21:36,382
with the dat file central to your case.

319
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,006
You're that hot little thing

320
00:21:44,008 --> 00:21:45,591
that came by here a month ago.

321
00:21:45,643 --> 00:21:49,395
The girl from Allsafe.

322
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:55,234
I remember, yeah.

323
00:21:59,190 --> 00:22:04,694
Okay... I'm gonna answer your question.

324
00:22:04,696 --> 00:22:07,613
But here's what I need from you first.

325
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:10,950
So I'm gonna pull down my pants,

326
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:14,036
and then I'm gonna need you to
take that pouty mouth of yours

327
00:22:14,088 --> 00:22:16,539
and swallow up my balls.

328
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:19,792
Now, they're big and hairy,
especially the left one,

329
00:22:19,844 --> 00:22:22,128
so you're really gonna
have to, I don't know,

330
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,514
squish 'em up to get 'em inside there.

331
00:22:25,550 --> 00:22:28,050
You're probably gonna have
to do one cheek at a time.

332
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:32,638
But then, once they're
all warm and snug in there,

333
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:36,225
I want you to repeat your question to me

334
00:22:36,277 --> 00:22:39,478
as clearly as you can.

335
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:43,733
Then, and only then,
am I willing to answer.

336
00:22:47,905 --> 00:22:50,906
What do you say?

337
00:23:08,426 --> 00:23:12,561
If you don't take this deal...

338
00:23:12,597 --> 00:23:16,432
you'll become like me.

339
00:23:16,484 --> 00:23:21,353
Sure, maybe you'll live in this house...

340
00:23:21,406 --> 00:23:23,606
maybe you'll have money,

341
00:23:23,658 --> 00:23:25,775
but even if your expensive
lawyers find a way

342
00:23:25,827 --> 00:23:30,613
to get you off, people will
still think that you're guilty.

343
00:23:36,954 --> 00:23:42,758
Losing everyone's respect...

344
00:23:44,962 --> 00:23:47,763
The respect of people you know

345
00:23:47,799 --> 00:23:53,719
and the people you don't...

346
00:23:53,771 --> 00:23:58,641
it's a shitty feeling.

347
00:23:58,693 --> 00:24:01,477
Trust me.

348
00:24:14,659 --> 00:24:18,661
I'll have "the girl" let me out.

349
00:24:25,503 --> 00:24:28,838
Flipper. Is she microchipped?

350
00:24:36,063 --> 00:24:39,682
Okay, very good.

351
00:24:39,734 --> 00:24:40,900
Housekeeping done.

352
00:24:40,901 --> 00:24:43,686
Now onto the real business.

353
00:24:44,095 --> 00:24:50,432
- Has your dog ever eaten trash before?
- No. I mean, not that I remember.

354
00:24:50,433 --> 00:24:52,661
Well, lucky for your bank account,

355
00:24:52,697 --> 00:24:54,864
the piece is small
enough to pass on its own.

356
00:24:54,916 --> 00:24:56,866
Unfortunately, though, it's large enough

357
00:24:56,868 --> 00:24:58,868
to send her puking all over your apartment.

358
00:24:58,870 --> 00:25:02,872
So I would crate her for
a few days and monitor her.

359
00:25:02,924 --> 00:25:05,592
She won't know what you're
doing is good for her.

360
00:25:19,774 --> 00:25:21,190
What the hell did you do?

361
00:25:21,225 --> 00:25:23,726
You were right. I was
only trying to prove...

362
00:25:23,728 --> 00:25:26,278
Colby's lawyers
just called. He wants to talk.

363
00:25:27,199 --> 00:25:29,900
Get back there.

364
00:25:40,245 --> 00:25:43,245
It's a little early in the
morning to be nerding out,

365
00:25:43,297 --> 00:25:47,629
- don't you think?
- How long?

366
00:25:54,225 --> 00:25:55,724
- Hmm?
- I knew if I asked you that...

367
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,255
- How long?
- Couple weeks.

368
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:06,769
And you had the balls to ask
for whiterose with my shit?

369
00:26:06,771 --> 00:26:09,772
It's like you want to get us both killed.

370
00:26:09,824 --> 00:26:12,661
What happened? He responded?

371
00:26:14,278 --> 00:26:17,913
You know, you didn't have to make me look

372
00:26:17,949 --> 00:26:19,365
like a shitty foot soldier.

373
00:26:19,417 --> 00:26:23,205
- Nobody would ever even know...
- You got root on my box and found the IP,

374
00:26:23,206 --> 00:26:27,006
then you joined their
channel with my handle.

375
00:26:31,846 --> 00:26:35,965
We're so done.

376
00:26:35,967 --> 00:26:37,633
I don't want to see you again.

377
00:26:44,108 --> 00:26:46,442
But you fools actually got your wish.

378
00:26:48,145 --> 00:26:49,029
I don't know why,

379
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:50,482
but the meeting's actually gonna be on.

380
00:26:51,182 --> 00:26:53,482
I'd tell you to be careful, but I know

381
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:55,384
that's the last thing you're gonna be.

382
00:27:11,281 --> 00:27:16,035
My lawyers are looking over the paperwork.

383
00:27:16,087 --> 00:27:19,505
- Does that mean that...
- Exactly what I said.

384
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,707
I asked you back here to make
sure that you can pull off

385
00:27:21,759 --> 00:27:24,376
your testimony, make sure that this

386
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:26,011
chain of custody story
of yours is straight.

387
00:27:26,047 --> 00:27:31,717
- I can't afford any trips.
- I'm not going to trip.

388
00:27:35,056 --> 00:27:37,306
So, what...

389
00:27:37,358 --> 00:27:38,974
what's in this for you, anyway?

390
00:27:39,026 --> 00:27:41,977
I know you hate me.

391
00:27:41,979 --> 00:27:44,396
So, what, you're gonna
just let me off Scot-free?

392
00:27:44,448 --> 00:27:51,141
- What do you get out of this?
- Earlier, I asked you a question.

393
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,491
You never answered it.

394
00:27:55,493 --> 00:28:00,879
If I'm agreeing to testify
in your case, then, yes,

395
00:28:00,915 --> 00:28:03,332
you know, I attended several meetings.

396
00:28:03,334 --> 00:28:08,504
Tell me about the one when
they decided to ignore the leak.

397
00:28:08,506 --> 00:28:10,839
I'm not sure what you're asking.

398
00:28:10,841 --> 00:28:14,560
What was the meeting like
when you decided this?

399
00:28:17,098 --> 00:28:19,682
I get it.

400
00:28:19,684 --> 00:28:22,434
You want to know, like, what was it like?

401
00:28:22,486 --> 00:28:26,689
Like, um, did we all have
cigars and laugh hysterically

402
00:28:26,741 --> 00:28:28,741
as we signed the evil documents?

403
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,526
Is that what you pictured?

404
00:28:30,578 --> 00:28:31,910
Well, I'm sorry, hon.

405
00:28:31,946 --> 00:28:34,580
See, the world doesn't work like that.

406
00:28:34,615 --> 00:28:38,751
Tell me. Tell me how it works.

407
00:28:41,956 --> 00:28:45,541
Uh, Jesus, um... all right, all right.

408
00:28:45,543 --> 00:28:50,596
Let's see. January, '93.

409
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:53,265
Well, my secretary then was Elaine.

410
00:28:53,301 --> 00:28:55,768
So Elaine brought us a
platter of shrimp cocktail

411
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:59,888
to tide us to dinner, which pissed us off

412
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:03,275
because we just had a
platter at the holiday party.

413
00:29:03,311 --> 00:29:04,727
Jim opened the bar.

414
00:29:04,779 --> 00:29:07,229
Now Jim was a real piece of work.

415
00:29:07,231 --> 00:29:09,481
I mean, half pansy, half mafia.

416
00:29:09,533 --> 00:29:12,985
First sign of a tight
decision, he'd be chain smoking

417
00:29:13,037 --> 00:29:15,904
down a river of scotch.

418
00:29:15,906 --> 00:29:19,241
Uh...

419
00:29:19,293 --> 00:29:21,076
you know, it rained.

420
00:29:21,078 --> 00:29:24,046
It rained. I remember that, yeah.

421
00:29:28,085 --> 00:29:30,469
So...

422
00:29:30,504 --> 00:29:36,091
you were drunk, eating shrimp cocktail,

423
00:29:36,143 --> 00:29:39,812
and it was raining when you
decided my mother would die?

424
00:29:47,772 --> 00:29:50,939
That's why.

425
00:29:50,941 --> 00:29:54,693
So people like you won't keep
sitting in rooms together.

426
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:07,122
Did any of it ever give you or anyone pause

427
00:30:07,124 --> 00:30:13,980
- when you made those decisions?
- Yeah.

428
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:17,800
Yeah, sure.

429
00:30:20,721 --> 00:30:24,973
But, um...

430
00:30:24,975 --> 00:30:29,361
then you go home, and,
uh, and you have dinner,

431
00:30:29,397 --> 00:30:34,032
you know, and you
wake up the next morning.

432
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:45,494
Here's to a man who has a
bright future at our company,

433
00:30:45,496 --> 00:30:47,913
a man you all know,

434
00:30:47,965 --> 00:30:51,417
a man who is going to change
this company for the good,

435
00:30:51,469 --> 00:30:56,505
a man smart enough to marry
a woman every bit his equal...

436
00:30:58,259 --> 00:31:03,178
Our new Chief Technology
Officer, Scott Knowles.

437
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:06,321
- Here, here!
- Thank you. Thank you.

438
00:31:06,734 --> 00:31:08,016
- Thank you, Phillip.
- Welcome.

439
00:31:08,068 --> 00:31:09,685
- Thank you very much.
- Here we go.

440
00:31:09,687 --> 00:31:11,236
- It's great to be here.
- And we're off.

441
00:31:11,272 --> 00:31:12,938
- Thanks, Phillip.
- You're very welcome.

442
00:31:12,990 --> 00:31:15,274
- Congratulations, darling.
- Thank you, thank you.

443
00:31:15,326 --> 00:31:17,776
- I'll leave you to it, okay?
- Don't break a sweat.

444
00:31:17,828 --> 00:31:19,945
- Oh, here, come, say hello.
- Hey, Joe, how are you?

445
00:31:23,918 --> 00:31:25,918
_

446
00:31:40,684 --> 00:31:43,101
Thank you.

447
00:31:48,142 --> 00:31:51,894
- Tyrell, nice to see you.
- Is it?

448
00:31:51,896 --> 00:31:54,062
I hear you shared our
moment with your husband.

449
00:31:54,064 --> 00:31:55,898
Oh, come on.

450
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,616
That was over a month ago.

451
00:31:57,651 --> 00:32:00,402
Don't tell me you're still sore.

452
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:03,489
Hmm, I sense some defeat.

453
00:32:10,831 --> 00:32:15,918
Well, I considered myself, at
the very least, reprimanded.

454
00:32:15,920 --> 00:32:17,636
How disappointing.

455
00:32:17,671 --> 00:32:20,255
One tiny curveball and you gave up.

456
00:32:20,307 --> 00:32:23,509
- Miss.
- Thank you.

457
00:32:23,561 --> 00:32:25,093
Should have known that
you were nothing more

458
00:32:25,145 --> 00:32:27,646
than a bold entrance.

459
00:32:27,681 --> 00:32:30,182
Are you saying you don't
crave a bold entrance

460
00:32:30,234 --> 00:32:34,653
every time, over and over, sustained?

461
00:32:34,688 --> 00:32:38,440
- Meet me tonight.
- I'm a little busy.

462
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,493
- Come to my office now.
- Are you really asking me that?

463
00:32:41,529 --> 00:32:44,613
I don't recall phrasing
it as a question, no.

464
00:32:44,665 --> 00:32:47,833
Fine, then I just won't show up.

465
00:32:47,868 --> 00:32:49,868
Then the roof.

466
00:32:49,920 --> 00:32:52,337
Take the back stairwell.

467
00:32:52,373 --> 00:32:54,623
The cameras have been out since March.

468
00:32:54,625 --> 00:32:57,709
No one will know.

469
00:33:02,716 --> 00:33:04,383
Well, you just made a long day longer.

470
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:06,218
I know that Allsafe will have to fire me,

471
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,053
but testifying was the right thing to do.

472
00:33:08,105 --> 00:33:10,722
I have worked my ass
off to take care of you

473
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,524
and of every person in this company.

474
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:16,547
- Do you know what that means?
- You've been a great boss, Gideon...

475
00:33:16,548 --> 00:33:19,648
See, once this confession goes public,

476
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,650
no one will want to do business with us.

477
00:33:21,702 --> 00:33:23,235
The company will go under.

478
00:33:23,287 --> 00:33:24,703
I couldn't let Colby take the fall

479
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:26,488
- for something that I did.
- Oh, come on!

480
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:28,156
You and I both know you
didn't break chain of custody.

481
00:33:28,158 --> 00:33:34,296
- I did and I feel terrible...
- Angela! Please! Stop lying.

482
00:33:37,801 --> 00:33:43,088
You do this... all these people go down,

483
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,174
all their families that rely

484
00:33:46,226 --> 00:33:49,728
on what this company provides for them.

485
00:34:11,502 --> 00:34:15,754
So this is where the rabbit hole leads?

486
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:16,922
Got to be honest,

487
00:34:16,957 --> 00:34:19,958
I half-expected you not to show up.

488
00:34:20,010 --> 00:34:23,879
And I half-expected
you to be a tattletale.

489
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:25,797
So you are sore.

490
00:34:25,849 --> 00:34:28,300
Oh, come on. You intrigued me.

491
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:30,886
I intrigued back.

492
00:34:30,938 --> 00:34:35,783
- Can't we just be more straightforward?
- Oh, that's no fun, but if you insist,

493
00:34:36,439 --> 00:34:38,810
I just came up here to
see if you were really

494
00:34:38,862 --> 00:34:41,897
as gullible as you seem.

495
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:44,399
My husband's downstairs
getting the job that you want,

496
00:34:44,451 --> 00:34:46,401
and you're up here trying to fuck me.

497
00:34:46,453 --> 00:34:48,904
Now whether that's you
being straightforward

498
00:34:48,906 --> 00:34:51,123
or a game, either way,

499
00:34:51,158 --> 00:34:56,411
- it's played pretty poorly, if you ask me.
- Hmm. Again, I asked no question.

500
00:34:56,413 --> 00:34:58,413
All I can tell you is you need this

501
00:34:58,465 --> 00:35:00,799
'cause you're dissatisfied.

502
00:35:00,834 --> 00:35:03,585
Scott plans on firing you,

503
00:35:03,587 --> 00:35:07,589
and you are clinging on
to any chance you can get.

504
00:35:07,641 --> 00:35:11,093
You seem desperate.

505
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:00,642
Hey... hey!

506
00:36:00,694 --> 00:36:03,145
What do you... get off of me!

507
00:36:03,197 --> 00:36:05,697
Stop!

508
00:38:03,795 --> 00:38:05,879
We connected with whiterose.

509
00:38:05,914 --> 00:38:07,914
The plan is back on.

510
00:38:10,252 --> 00:38:14,587
I could bullshit you, tell
you you're the only person

511
00:38:14,639 --> 00:38:19,092
who can fill the exact
void we have at Fsociety.

512
00:38:19,144 --> 00:38:21,177
The truth is, I need
this group back together.

513
00:38:26,601 --> 00:38:27,934
Have you ever considered which part

514
00:38:27,986 --> 00:38:30,937
of our scheme motivates you?

515
00:38:30,939 --> 00:38:32,822
When the Dark Army bailed, you didn't care

516
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:35,909
if pushing a button would
bring an economic revolution.

517
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:39,112
You want momentary anarchy.

518
00:38:39,114 --> 00:38:40,780
The others?

519
00:38:40,782 --> 00:38:42,615
Mobley likes palling around.

520
00:38:42,667 --> 00:38:45,285
Romero wants a whiff of fame.

521
00:38:45,337 --> 00:38:48,004
Those reasons depress me.

522
00:38:51,710 --> 00:38:56,012
- What's the part you want?
- You don't care.

523
00:39:03,388 --> 00:39:05,638
My parents were born in Iran.

524
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,774
They came here like everybody else,

525
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:08,975
for freedom,

526
00:39:09,027 --> 00:39:11,144
but my dad works 60-hour weeks

527
00:39:11,146 --> 00:39:15,031
to determine tax loopholes
for a millionaire art dealer.

528
00:39:15,066 --> 00:39:17,951
My mom, she ran up loans into five digits

529
00:39:17,986 --> 00:39:20,820
to get an online degree.

530
00:39:20,872 --> 00:39:24,490
They won't shut up about
how great America is.

531
00:39:24,543 --> 00:39:27,293
But they're gonna die in debt doing things

532
00:39:27,329 --> 00:39:29,412
they never wanted to do.

533
00:39:36,504 --> 00:39:38,295
There are how many billion

534
00:39:38,296 --> 00:39:41,808
- people in this world?
- 7.3.

535
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:45,812
Somehow you and I landed together...

536
00:39:45,847 --> 00:39:48,565
doing something impossible
if we were alone,

537
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,067
not to mention at the
right point in history

538
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:53,486
with the right resources.

539
00:39:53,521 --> 00:39:55,188
We have what we've worked for

540
00:39:55,190 --> 00:39:57,740
right there for the taking.

541
00:39:57,776 --> 00:40:00,410
We just need each other
to see this through.

542
00:40:15,427 --> 00:40:18,127
You come any closer, I'm calling the cops.

543
00:40:23,218 --> 00:40:27,220
Hi, operator. I'd like
to report an emergency.

544
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,889
I placed a malicious
CD in my work computer,

545
00:40:29,891 --> 00:40:33,359
and now this guy at the
gym is saying hi to me.

546
00:40:33,395 --> 00:40:35,999
- I'm going home.
- I need you to do something for me.

547
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:38,531
Call the girl who wants
to be involved, okay?

548
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:39,949
Her name is Angela Moss.

549
00:40:39,985 --> 00:40:41,834
- Let me give you her phone number.
- Listen, pussy.

550
00:40:41,835 --> 00:40:43,453
If you don't do what I say,

551
00:40:43,488 --> 00:40:45,905
then the giant shit storm
that rains turds later

552
00:40:45,957 --> 00:40:49,909
will leave a trail of clouds in
the sky spelling out your name.

553
00:40:58,086 --> 00:40:59,322
Elliot?

554
00:41:00,766 --> 00:41:05,215
- I wasn't expecting you.
- I'm here for my appointment.

555
00:41:07,762 --> 00:41:10,430
Well, you can slip in
before my first patient.

556
00:41:30,709 --> 00:41:34,838
- You told me I should tell you the truth.
- Yes.

557
00:41:36,708 --> 00:41:41,961
Everything I say will still
be protected and confidential?

558
00:41:47,719 --> 00:41:52,138
I've been lying to you.

559
00:41:52,140 --> 00:41:54,857
I don't take my pills.

560
00:41:54,893 --> 00:41:58,311
But you don't either.

561
00:41:58,313 --> 00:42:00,196
Your refill frequency
for Ativan doesn't match

562
00:42:00,231 --> 00:42:02,448
your prescription divided by the dosage.

563
00:42:07,906 --> 00:42:11,374
This morning...

564
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:14,160
you bought a tall hazelnut latte.

565
00:42:14,212 --> 00:42:17,046
Paid for it on your Evil Corp card.

566
00:42:17,082 --> 00:42:19,999
By text, you justified the
indulgence to your sister

567
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,168
because Evil Corp gives you double rewards.

568
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:26,005
But those points only
accumulate on travel expenses.

569
00:42:26,007 --> 00:42:28,674
You're not good with money.

570
00:42:28,727 --> 00:42:33,146
On paper, your Thursday
2:00, Marilyn O'Brien,

571
00:42:33,181 --> 00:42:35,848
is your doppelganger.

572
00:42:35,900 --> 00:42:39,068
I think you're encouraging her

573
00:42:39,104 --> 00:42:43,322
to leave her husband...

574
00:42:43,358 --> 00:42:45,358
because you're tired of being dumped.

575
00:42:49,247 --> 00:42:51,030
You like porn, especially anal.

576
00:42:51,082 --> 00:42:52,698
Whether you like it yourself, I don't know.

577
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:55,084
That's not relevant to me.

578
00:42:55,120 --> 00:42:57,203
You've told your best friend Jennifer

579
00:42:57,205 --> 00:43:03,042
that you wish your mom would die.

580
00:43:03,044 --> 00:43:06,429
I sometimes watch you on your webcam.

581
00:43:06,464 --> 00:43:10,716
You cry sometimes...

582
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:15,221
just like me.

583
00:43:15,273 --> 00:43:17,890
Because you're lonely.

584
00:43:23,782 --> 00:43:25,698
I don't just hack you, Krista.

585
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,284
I hack everyone...

586
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:31,454
my friends, coworkers.

587
00:43:36,911 --> 00:43:39,962
But I've helped a lot of people.

588
00:43:45,503 --> 00:43:49,755
I want...

589
00:43:49,808 --> 00:43:54,811
a way out of loneliness...

590
00:43:54,846 --> 00:43:57,396
just like you.

591
00:44:08,776 --> 00:44:12,161
Is that what you wanted to hear?
