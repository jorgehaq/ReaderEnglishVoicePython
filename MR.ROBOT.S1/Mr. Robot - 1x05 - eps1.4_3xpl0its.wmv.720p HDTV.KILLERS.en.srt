1
00:00:01,041 --> 00:00:04,121
He wants to hack Steel
Mountain's climate control system,

2
00:00:04,122 --> 00:00:07,454
raise the facility's heat high
enough to destroy all the tapes.

3
00:00:07,455 --> 00:00:08,248
This is what we're doing.

4
00:00:08,283 --> 00:00:10,450
I'll hit up my Dark Army contact
as soon as you take off.

5
00:00:10,485 --> 00:00:13,673
You just gonna hit up the
world's most dangerous hacker crew?

6
00:00:13,674 --> 00:00:15,088
He has my bank account, Ollie.

7
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:20,367
We cannot just infect Allsafe's network
because of this. I'll lose my job.

8
00:00:20,545 --> 00:00:22,796
Evil Corp's upping their
security protocol.

9
00:00:22,848 --> 00:00:23,797
They are physically copying,

10
00:00:23,849 --> 00:00:26,154
then shipping all
the analog backups.

11
00:00:26,155 --> 00:00:27,434
We go up today.

12
00:00:34,176 --> 00:00:37,528
I want you to be where
you belong, here with me.

13
00:00:37,579 --> 00:00:40,180
I think I'm happy where I am.

14
00:00:40,215 --> 00:00:42,282
Don't let
me down, okay?

15
00:00:42,317 --> 00:00:44,534
That girl in there is mine.

16
00:00:44,569 --> 00:00:46,486
Did you have something
to do with Vera getting busted?

17
00:00:46,521 --> 00:00:48,538
He's on murder charges.
Do you know that?

18
00:00:48,573 --> 00:00:50,323
It's my plan. I'll go in.

19
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,042
You might be able to
hide it from these nerds,

20
00:00:52,077 --> 00:00:53,960
but I know a junkie
when I see one.

21
00:00:53,996 --> 00:00:56,716
- I'm alone.
- No, you're not.

22
00:00:56,717 --> 00:00:58,498
I'm not going anywhere, kiddo.

23
00:01:22,024 --> 00:01:23,523
I wish I had better
news for you, Fernando,

24
00:01:23,525 --> 00:01:25,692
but this isn't the
you're-getting-out meeting.

25
00:01:27,362 --> 00:01:29,863
This is only as much
as I could carry.

26
00:01:29,865 --> 00:01:31,081
The D.A. has more.

27
00:01:33,585 --> 00:01:37,404
- How long this gonna be?
- We're talking years.

28
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:38,705
Yo, you playing?

29
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:40,674
You get our people out.

30
00:01:40,709 --> 00:01:42,275
That's your use to us.

31
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:44,044
They have a solid case.

32
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:45,645
For every charge they're
gonna lay on you,

33
00:01:45,681 --> 00:01:48,915
they have these binders,
your Twitters, your Instagram.

34
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:53,269
You said they wouldn't
figure this shit out.

35
00:01:53,305 --> 00:01:54,354
They can't, brah.

36
00:01:54,389 --> 00:01:56,523
I'm telling you, it
was airtight, V.

37
00:01:56,558 --> 00:01:59,526
Fellas, this isn't
the imitation game.

38
00:01:59,561 --> 00:02:01,111
The code here is not
that complicated.

39
00:02:01,146 --> 00:02:03,063
Besides, who told you
to put your business

40
00:02:03,065 --> 00:02:05,615
anywhere near social media?

41
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,785
My aspirational
little brother.

42
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:12,789
You know how much money
we saved last year?

43
00:02:12,824 --> 00:02:15,075
Made our whole operation
way more efficient.

44
00:02:15,077 --> 00:02:16,543
We were careful.

45
00:02:16,578 --> 00:02:17,939
You tweeted about
every transaction

46
00:02:17,963 --> 00:02:19,079
your business was involved in.

47
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:21,798
That is the opposite
of careful.

48
00:02:21,833 --> 00:02:25,418
It's no wonder an
anonymous tip turned you in.

49
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:29,222
- Who called in the tip?
- This is what is meant by anonymous.

50
00:02:29,257 --> 00:02:31,091
It is now spilled milk.

51
00:02:31,143 --> 00:02:32,142
The information got out,

52
00:02:32,177 --> 00:02:34,427
and now they're
coming down hard.

53
00:02:34,429 --> 00:02:35,589
There's no plea on the table.

54
00:02:35,597 --> 00:02:37,097
They're gonna lay
murder one on you.

55
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:38,598
I ain't pleading anyway.

56
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,983
Men can't sentence me.

57
00:02:40,018 --> 00:02:42,402
That is a cosmic
responsibility.

58
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,741
Someone's gonna get
hurt for this.

59
00:02:47,776 --> 00:02:49,859
That's how we get square
with the universe.

60
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,112
Fernando, we need to
discuss strategy.

61
00:02:52,164 --> 00:02:55,616
- You don't want Supermax.
- Naw, naw.

62
00:02:58,703 --> 00:03:02,417
If they lock me up, the kind of
door they close don't matter.

63
00:03:27,649 --> 00:03:31,913
So that's you.
That's who you are.

64
00:03:32,988 --> 00:03:36,218
I know you.

65
00:03:47,436 --> 00:03:51,217
Synced and corrected by skoad

66
00:04:09,524 --> 00:04:10,523
Excuse me.

67
00:04:10,525 --> 00:04:12,025
Pardon me. Pardon me.
I already paid.

68
00:04:12,077 --> 00:04:13,693
Just want to pay my respects.

69
00:04:13,695 --> 00:04:14,861
Thank you. Thank you.

70
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,496
Ooh, I'm sorry, man. Sorry.

71
00:04:16,531 --> 00:04:18,198
Just want to pay
my compliments.

72
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:20,867
Hey, excellent coffee,
fantastic service.

73
00:04:20,869 --> 00:04:23,554
Buy yourself something nice.

74
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:36,970
_

75
00:04:38,436 --> 00:04:40,937
Steel Mountain.

76
00:04:40,972 --> 00:04:43,056
We're trying to penetrate
a data security facility

77
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,308
whose tagline literally is...

78
00:04:51,366 --> 00:04:53,399
Nothing is actually
impenetrable.

79
00:04:53,451 --> 00:04:55,768
A place like this says
it is, and it's close,

80
00:04:55,804 --> 00:04:58,705
but people still
built this place.

81
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,039
And if you can hack
the right person,

82
00:05:00,075 --> 00:05:01,324
all of a sudden,

83
00:05:01,376 --> 00:05:03,743
you have a piece of
powerful malware.

84
00:05:03,795 --> 00:05:06,412
People always make
the best exploits.

85
00:05:06,464 --> 00:05:09,332
I've never found it
hard to hack most people.

86
00:05:09,384 --> 00:05:11,334
If you listen to
them, watch them,

87
00:05:11,386 --> 00:05:12,752
their vulnerabilities are like

88
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:15,088
a neon sign screwed
into their heads.

89
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:16,756
Mobley's a glutton.

90
00:05:16,808 --> 00:05:18,591
He lacks discipline
from his urges.

91
00:05:18,643 --> 00:05:20,927
I don't want to get
bugs. They spread disease.

92
00:05:20,929 --> 00:05:23,396
Romero is a know-it-all
and a hypochondriac.

93
00:05:23,431 --> 00:05:25,798
Bill Harper
is our first exploit.

94
00:05:25,834 --> 00:05:27,333
He isn't gonna give the
search much scrutiny.

95
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,568
He'll get us to Level 1,

96
00:05:28,603 --> 00:05:29,936
but Bill is not gonna be
able to get us to Level 2.

97
00:05:29,988 --> 00:05:31,938
And we need to get to Level 2.

98
00:05:31,990 --> 00:05:34,607
You're gonna ask to speak
to his supervisor, Wendy.

99
00:05:34,609 --> 00:05:36,643
She'll get us to exactly
where we need to be.

100
00:05:36,678 --> 00:05:38,661
Then we'll be able to get
rid of her from the van.

101
00:05:38,697 --> 00:05:41,114
After that, you connect
the Raspberry Pi

102
00:05:41,116 --> 00:05:43,416
to the climate control
system, and Bob's your uncle.

103
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,424
Now we can hear you,
and you can hear us.

104
00:05:51,459 --> 00:05:52,759
Mr. Robot?

105
00:05:52,794 --> 00:05:54,627
His flaw is he's
absolutely insane.

106
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,596
We're talking clinical.

107
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:58,848
When they say, "If your friends
jump off a bridge, would you?"

108
00:05:58,883 --> 00:06:00,967
he would, without hesitation,

109
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,468
just to prove something.

110
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:04,137
He goes in there, he's liable
to blow the whole place up,

111
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,472
just like he wanted to
in the first place.

112
00:06:06,474 --> 00:06:07,994
Sure you don't want
to look over the info

113
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:10,310
- and the map again?
- I got it.

114
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,112
Okay, James Bond, let's
go mess their shit up.

115
00:06:13,148 --> 00:06:14,280
Boom, boom.

116
00:06:16,985 --> 00:06:19,319
Yes, I also
have security flaws.

117
00:06:19,371 --> 00:06:21,154
I don't like being outside.

118
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,572
I liked morphine too much.

119
00:06:22,624 --> 00:06:24,457
Mr. Sepiol?

120
00:06:24,492 --> 00:06:25,825
I'm talking
to you right now,

121
00:06:25,827 --> 00:06:27,493
and you don't exist.

122
00:06:27,495 --> 00:06:30,129
Sam Sepiol?

123
00:06:30,165 --> 00:06:31,798
Sir?

124
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,334
That's you, Elliot.

125
00:06:34,386 --> 00:06:36,252
Okay.

126
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,670
So sorry you had to wait.

127
00:06:37,672 --> 00:06:40,173
As you can see, there's
always a lot of bustle here.

128
00:06:40,225 --> 00:06:41,507
How can I help you today?

129
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:44,093
You need a
tour. Don't elaborate.

130
00:06:44,145 --> 00:06:47,263
Um... a tour.

131
00:06:48,683 --> 00:06:50,350
Okay.

132
00:06:50,352 --> 00:06:51,985
I'm sure they told
you at reception

133
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:54,520
that we... we require
appointments for tours.

134
00:06:54,572 --> 00:06:57,273
My supervisor gives us
all a hard time about that.

135
00:06:58,276 --> 00:07:01,361
I'm Sam Sepiol.

136
00:07:01,363 --> 00:07:02,578
You should look me up.

137
00:07:02,614 --> 00:07:04,080
Okay.

138
00:07:04,115 --> 00:07:07,000
A little inelegant,
but we can work with it.

139
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,201
Tell you what.

140
00:07:08,203 --> 00:07:10,620
Have your company call
over to new accounts,

141
00:07:10,672 --> 00:07:13,423
and we can set something
up later this week.

142
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:15,291
Ask for Bill Harper.

143
00:07:15,343 --> 00:07:16,292
They'll know where to find me.

144
00:07:16,344 --> 00:07:17,543
Listen, Bill.

145
00:07:17,545 --> 00:07:19,712
You think your boss
gives you a hard time now?

146
00:07:19,714 --> 00:07:21,214
You're gonna get a
really hard time

147
00:07:21,216 --> 00:07:22,416
right after I
walk out of here.

148
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:24,384
I'm not rescheduling, Bill.

149
00:07:24,386 --> 00:07:26,352
When I walk out that door,
I'm never coming back.

150
00:07:26,388 --> 00:07:28,388
That's your ass, Bill.

151
00:07:30,725 --> 00:07:32,725
I really think you
should look me up.

152
00:07:34,229 --> 00:07:36,195
It... it just doesn't
work like that.

153
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:38,231
I'm sorry, sir.

154
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:40,233
You take care, okay?

155
00:07:45,907 --> 00:07:47,990
I'm coming out.
It's not working.

156
00:07:48,043 --> 00:07:49,125
It's gonna work.

157
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,326
Hang in there.

158
00:07:50,378 --> 00:07:51,794
I was being too weird.

159
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:53,546
Just like every
other tech billionaire.

160
00:07:53,581 --> 00:07:56,416
Slow your roll.
It's gonna happen.

161
00:08:00,088 --> 00:08:03,089
It's no wonder
Wikipedia is never accurate.

162
00:08:03,091 --> 00:08:06,592
Anyone can edit them.

163
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:07,894
Well, not anyone.

164
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,680
Nerds like Mobley built a
lot of credit over the years

165
00:08:10,732 --> 00:08:12,432
with his 20,000 edits.

166
00:08:12,434 --> 00:08:14,517
And still people trust it,

167
00:08:14,569 --> 00:08:17,403
beholden to all the Mobleys of
the world for their information.

168
00:08:17,439 --> 00:08:19,322
Mr. Sepiol?

169
00:08:19,357 --> 00:08:20,523
Mr. Sepiol!

170
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:22,241
I have some good news.

171
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:26,594
Stop it. Stop it.

172
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:28,296
Can you stop packing
for, like, five minutes?

173
00:08:28,348 --> 00:08:30,631
Can we just hash this
out like adults?

174
00:08:30,684 --> 00:08:33,184
I love you.

175
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:34,602
You don't even know
why you're crying.

176
00:08:34,637 --> 00:08:36,771
Let's get married.

177
00:08:36,806 --> 00:08:38,139
Ollie, will you please stop?

178
00:08:38,141 --> 00:08:41,859
Angela... Angela, you can't
just give up on us like this.

179
00:08:48,034 --> 00:08:50,368
I mean, have you even
thought this through?

180
00:08:50,403 --> 00:08:52,954
What are you gonna do, go
live with your dad in Jersey?

181
00:08:52,989 --> 00:08:54,655
Come on.

182
00:08:56,326 --> 00:09:01,021
- You're ruining your life.
- Maybe, but I also ruined yours.

183
00:09:02,382 --> 00:09:04,499
Why do you have my work ID?

184
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:14,592
Did you...

185
00:09:14,644 --> 00:09:18,146
did you... do you... do you...

186
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,982
do you know what's
gonna happen?

187
00:09:21,017 --> 00:09:23,017
There will be fallout from this,
and I'm gonna tell them...

188
00:09:23,069 --> 00:09:27,321
I used your computer, so
tell them whatever you want.

189
00:09:27,357 --> 00:09:29,690
Are you serious?

190
00:09:29,743 --> 00:09:33,694
Did you even think about
how this would affect me?

191
00:09:36,249 --> 00:09:38,166
I did.

192
00:09:45,341 --> 00:09:47,508
Here's an idea
of how big this place is.

193
00:09:47,544 --> 00:09:50,044
We have our own fire department,
inside the building,

194
00:09:50,096 --> 00:09:51,512
just for us.

195
00:09:51,548 --> 00:09:54,449
And you can't have a fire
department without a fire truck,

196
00:09:54,484 --> 00:09:56,884
and you can't have a
fire truck without roads.

197
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,987
We have all of that, inside.

198
00:10:00,023 --> 00:10:01,689
Imagine that.

199
00:10:09,265 --> 00:10:11,632
Elliot, now's
the time we get rid of Bill.

200
00:10:12,669 --> 00:10:14,368
There's so much information...

201
00:10:14,404 --> 00:10:16,704
Okay, we're gonna
need to roll up our sleeves here.

202
00:10:16,739 --> 00:10:20,074
You have to destroy Bill in
order to get to a supervisor.

203
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,611
There's one vault in here
that's 200,000 square feet.

204
00:10:23,646 --> 00:10:25,146
That's the size of
a shopping mall,

205
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:27,415
and that's just one.

206
00:10:28,551 --> 00:10:32,560
- Bill, where are those giant vaults?
- They're on Level 2,

207
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,005
but that's not
part of the tour.

208
00:10:34,057 --> 00:10:36,224
Even I don't have
authorization.

209
00:10:36,259 --> 00:10:38,009
He's not gonna
take you for ice cream.

210
00:10:38,061 --> 00:10:39,811
He has to go away.

211
00:10:39,846 --> 00:10:42,763
There's no place in
this plan for Bill.

212
00:10:42,816 --> 00:10:45,600
Now, right down here...

213
00:10:45,652 --> 00:10:47,101
Everything okay, sir?

214
00:10:47,103 --> 00:10:50,021
We need to tear
Bill down piece by piece.

215
00:10:50,073 --> 00:10:53,241
You need to wipe that smile
off of his stupid face.

216
00:10:53,276 --> 00:10:55,827
Sir, are you okay?

217
00:10:55,862 --> 00:10:58,663
You're not... you're
not saying anything.

218
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,867
Dig
into him, Elliot.

219
00:11:07,957 --> 00:11:10,758
You of all people can
do this, Elliot.

220
00:11:10,793 --> 00:11:13,628
You know how it feels when
someone makes you small.

221
00:11:13,630 --> 00:11:16,380
You understand what
happens when someone exposes

222
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,432
the thing you fear
most about yourself.

223
00:11:18,468 --> 00:11:19,433
Answer me!

224
00:11:19,469 --> 00:11:20,968
Answer me!

225
00:11:23,389 --> 00:11:24,856
Get up.

226
00:11:24,891 --> 00:11:28,142
Just get up!

227
00:11:29,445 --> 00:11:31,646
I hate you.

228
00:11:31,698 --> 00:11:34,699
You're nothing.

229
00:11:34,734 --> 00:11:36,234
You're worthless.

230
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:41,956
Think about it, Bill.

231
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:44,375
Think about what?

232
00:11:48,998 --> 00:11:50,665
If you died,

233
00:11:50,667 --> 00:11:53,167
would anyone care?

234
00:11:55,171 --> 00:11:58,005
Would they really care?

235
00:11:58,057 --> 00:12:01,559
Yeah, maybe they'd
cry for a day,

236
00:12:01,594 --> 00:12:03,010
but let's be honest.

237
00:12:03,062 --> 00:12:06,180
No one would give a shit.

238
00:12:06,232 --> 00:12:08,432
They wouldn't.

239
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,852
The few people that would feel
obligated to go to your funeral

240
00:12:11,854 --> 00:12:14,522
would probably be annoyed

241
00:12:14,574 --> 00:12:17,108
and leave as early
as possible.

242
00:12:26,169 --> 00:12:28,703
That's who you are.

243
00:12:28,755 --> 00:12:31,289
That's what you are.

244
00:12:31,341 --> 00:12:35,876
You're nothing to anyone,

245
00:12:35,929 --> 00:12:37,929
to everyone.

246
00:12:39,599 --> 00:12:42,300
Think about it, Bill.

247
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:46,187
'Cause if you do,

248
00:12:46,222 --> 00:12:48,222
if you let yourself...

249
00:12:50,393 --> 00:12:52,727
You'll know I'm telling
you the truth.

250
00:12:54,447 --> 00:12:57,064
So instead of wasting
any more of my time,

251
00:12:57,066 --> 00:13:00,952
I need you to go call
someone that matters,

252
00:13:00,987 --> 00:13:02,954
because, Bill...

253
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,407
You don't.

254
00:13:11,547 --> 00:13:14,665
I'll...

255
00:13:14,717 --> 00:13:16,717
I'll call my supervisor.

256
00:13:18,338 --> 00:13:21,088
And that's why Bill
Harper is a perfect exploit,

257
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,924
desperate enough for the
business to break protocol

258
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:27,228
and let me in.

259
00:13:27,263 --> 00:13:29,063
Lonely enough to break.

260
00:13:29,098 --> 00:13:32,266
I need a supervisor in L1S3.

261
00:13:32,318 --> 00:13:33,434
Copy that.

262
00:13:40,026 --> 00:13:41,942
Don't apologize.

263
00:13:41,944 --> 00:13:45,613
You're almost there.
You did great.

264
00:13:45,665 --> 00:13:47,782
Once Wendy gets
there, we'll send her a text

265
00:13:47,834 --> 00:13:51,285
letting her know her
pregnant wife is in labor.

266
00:13:51,287 --> 00:13:53,120
Once she leaves, that
should give you enough time

267
00:13:53,122 --> 00:13:54,789
to plant the Pi, you dig?

268
00:13:57,427 --> 00:13:58,626
Trudy Davis,
Accounts Supervisor.

269
00:13:58,678 --> 00:14:00,232
Is there a problem here?

270
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:02,008
- Mr. Sepiol is asking...
- Trudy?

271
00:14:02,009 --> 00:14:04,213
- What the fuck? - for
someone more senior than me.

272
00:14:04,434 --> 00:14:06,934
I don't seem to
have your name.

273
00:14:06,969 --> 00:14:10,771
I'm Sam Sepiol?

274
00:14:11,808 --> 00:14:13,802
- Is that a question?
- Trudy? Trudy?

275
00:14:13,803 --> 00:14:14,892
Where's Wendy?

276
00:14:14,944 --> 00:14:16,560
We only prepped for Wendy.
Where the hell is Wendy?

277
00:14:16,612 --> 00:14:18,312
I need Wendy, actually.

278
00:14:18,364 --> 00:14:21,982
And how do you know Wendy?
She didn't come in today.

279
00:14:24,545 --> 00:14:26,046
_

280
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,239
What is it that
you need, Mr. Sepiol?

281
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:31,792
Um...

282
00:14:31,828 --> 00:14:34,578
I would love a
tour of Level 2.

283
00:14:34,630 --> 00:14:35,663
I don't know what
you've been told,

284
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:37,665
but we don't allow that.

285
00:14:37,667 --> 00:14:39,667
I'll see you out.
You can go, Bill.

286
00:14:39,669 --> 00:14:41,802
Follow me to the lobby.

287
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:50,211
This woman's a ghost.

288
00:14:50,246 --> 00:14:51,445
None of these are her.

289
00:14:51,481 --> 00:14:52,646
No Facebook, no LinkedIn.

290
00:14:52,682 --> 00:14:54,315
She's been married
for 30 years.

291
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:55,983
All we have is her
husband's cell phone number.

292
00:14:56,018 --> 00:14:56,984
He doesn't even have
a picture online.

293
00:14:57,019 --> 00:14:58,619
No hobbies, no kids,

294
00:14:58,654 --> 00:15:01,455
no credit problems,
no weird sex stuff.

295
00:15:01,491 --> 00:15:02,957
House paid off.

296
00:15:02,992 --> 00:15:04,392
I need... I need
to... I need to think.

297
00:15:04,427 --> 00:15:08,329
The
elevator's almost here.

298
00:15:08,364 --> 00:15:13,167
Yes, that's how they work
when you press the button.

299
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:15,569
Okay.

300
00:15:15,605 --> 00:15:18,773
People... people are
all just people, right?

301
00:15:18,808 --> 00:15:20,274
When it gets down to
it, everyone's the same.

302
00:15:20,309 --> 00:15:21,409
They love something.

303
00:15:21,444 --> 00:15:22,643
They want something.
They fear something.

304
00:15:22,678 --> 00:15:24,412
Specifics help, but
specifics don't change

305
00:15:24,447 --> 00:15:25,913
the way that everyone
is vulnerable.

306
00:15:25,948 --> 00:15:30,050
It just changes the way that we
access those vulnerabilities.

307
00:15:34,074 --> 00:15:37,363
_

308
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:55,242
I-I have to go. I'm sorry.

309
00:15:55,244 --> 00:15:56,577
I need to go to my office.

310
00:15:56,579 --> 00:15:59,330
Reception will see you out.

311
00:16:07,473 --> 00:16:09,256
What'd you do?

312
00:16:09,308 --> 00:16:11,258
I spoofed a
text from her husband.

313
00:16:11,592 --> 00:16:15,443
_

314
00:16:23,587 --> 00:16:25,260
_

315
00:16:26,275 --> 00:16:27,825
It's a palm print scanner.

316
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:30,995
Get out of there.

317
00:16:31,030 --> 00:16:32,863
There's one
door manually locked.

318
00:16:32,915 --> 00:16:35,122
It's a fire code thing,
and I think you can pick it.

319
00:16:35,123 --> 00:16:37,051
- Where?
- It's at the end of the hallway

320
00:16:37,086 --> 00:16:39,503
if you're heading north on L1.

321
00:17:07,149 --> 00:17:08,148
The stairs don't
go to Level 2.

322
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,700
They go to a parking lot.

323
00:17:09,735 --> 00:17:12,369
You're on the complete
wrong side of the building.

324
00:17:12,405 --> 00:17:14,321
You're gonna have to double
back and go through the door

325
00:17:14,373 --> 00:17:17,374
you came in and
make a run for it.

326
00:17:21,697 --> 00:17:23,530
Elliot...

327
00:17:25,367 --> 00:17:27,501
I thought I saw you.

328
00:17:27,636 --> 00:17:29,052
What are you doing here?

329
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:33,377
Thank you. Y'all come
back to Wingstravaganza.

330
00:17:33,728 --> 00:17:34,844
Okay, real important...

331
00:17:34,896 --> 00:17:37,703
Wingstravaganza means
wings and extravaganza.

332
00:17:37,704 --> 00:17:40,500
- Do you know what extravaganza means?
- Yep, it's a big deal.

333
00:17:40,501 --> 00:17:42,235
You got it.

334
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:45,021
You look nervous.
Are you excited?

335
00:17:45,073 --> 00:17:46,830
- Yeah.
- Okay.

336
00:17:46,831 --> 00:17:49,650
So you'll shadow me for the
week, but don't sweat it.

337
00:17:49,651 --> 00:17:51,277
It's like every
other server job.

338
00:17:51,629 --> 00:17:53,868
Well, I've actually never
been a waitress before.

339
00:17:54,866 --> 00:17:56,833
This is kind of like
a new beginning for me.

340
00:17:57,368 --> 00:18:01,371
- What were you doing before?
- Pharmaceutical sales.

341
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:02,454
Fancy.

342
00:18:02,507 --> 00:18:04,044
You must have made bank.

343
00:18:04,331 --> 00:18:09,128
- What happened?
- Um, just, you know, Obamacare.

344
00:18:14,852 --> 00:18:18,137
Welcome to Steel
Mountain's data center.

345
00:18:18,189 --> 00:18:20,856
Our facility meets
diamond specifications

346
00:18:20,892 --> 00:18:24,226
and features a tier 10
certified build and design,

347
00:18:24,278 --> 00:18:27,396
providing you with a
safe, rock-solid fortress

348
00:18:27,448 --> 00:18:29,031
for your data needs.

349
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:31,150
All of our
facilities implement

350
00:18:31,202 --> 00:18:32,651
comprehensive
security measures...

351
00:18:32,703 --> 00:18:36,038
They say I'm overdoing
it, and I say exactly.

352
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,407
So yeah.

353
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,959
Elliot.

354
00:18:40,011 --> 00:18:41,794
- Nice meeting you.
- You too.

355
00:18:41,846 --> 00:18:45,214
- Tell your wife I said hi.
- I will.

356
00:18:45,216 --> 00:18:47,283
Those men I just
shook hands with,

357
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:50,603
financiers of
Hezbollah and ISIS.

358
00:18:50,638 --> 00:18:52,855
I wouldn't stare.

359
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:54,807
Did he know
I was gonna be here?

360
00:18:54,859 --> 00:18:56,475
Does he know why I'm here?

361
00:18:56,527 --> 00:18:58,728
Shit, he's gonna kill me.

362
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:04,150
- As you were saying?
- Just a routine data process check.

363
00:19:04,202 --> 00:19:07,319
Allsafe does them
all the time.

364
00:19:07,372 --> 00:19:09,455
But why would they send you?

365
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:11,374
That type of thing
isn't usually handled

366
00:19:11,409 --> 00:19:13,459
by the engineers, is it?

367
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:17,046
We've been overlapping
a lot in our duties.

368
00:19:17,098 --> 00:19:19,848
Budget reasons.

369
00:19:19,884 --> 00:19:24,303
It seems we both had the
idea to work off-site today.

370
00:19:24,355 --> 00:19:26,605
Let's call this fortuitous.

371
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:30,927
- Join me for lunch?
- S-sure.

372
00:19:32,613 --> 00:19:35,147
I eat lunch.

373
00:19:35,199 --> 00:19:37,950
So you are like
the rest of us.

374
00:19:40,321 --> 00:19:41,403
Come.

375
00:19:44,575 --> 00:19:45,741
He got owned, man.

376
00:19:45,776 --> 00:19:47,776
We got to go.

377
00:19:47,812 --> 00:19:48,812
We're not going anywhere.

378
00:19:48,846 --> 00:19:51,280
This changes nothing.

379
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,165
What can I get you, Elliot?

380
00:19:53,217 --> 00:19:54,500
Have a lot of things here.

381
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:55,913
He has
a vulnerability.

382
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:58,337
He's an arrogant prick,
and he's proud of it.

383
00:19:58,389 --> 00:20:00,506
He cares what you
think about him,

384
00:20:00,558 --> 00:20:02,141
even though he probably
hates that he does.

385
00:20:02,176 --> 00:20:05,060
Tyrell Wellick's greatest
asset is his hubris,

386
00:20:05,096 --> 00:20:07,679
but it's also his flaw,
and that's your exploit.

387
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:08,680
Would be nice.

388
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:10,733
You eat here?

389
00:20:12,737 --> 00:20:15,537
This place?

390
00:20:15,573 --> 00:20:17,773
Is that your
plan, to piss him off?

391
00:20:17,808 --> 00:20:19,575
No, wait, man. Wait.

392
00:20:21,687 --> 00:20:22,738
_

393
00:20:25,649 --> 00:20:26,698
Now remember, Elliot,

394
00:20:26,751 --> 00:20:29,368
you'll lose our
signal on Level 2.

395
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,120
Elliot.

396
00:20:32,289 --> 00:20:35,290
Elliot, say something
if you can hear us.

397
00:20:40,965 --> 00:20:43,882
I'm impressed you came
all the way out here.

398
00:20:43,934 --> 00:20:47,719
Allsafe is finished,
but you won't let it die.

399
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,521
We're the same.

400
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:51,056
We're perfectionists.

401
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,484
I've seen our waiter
here for the last...

402
00:21:02,536 --> 00:21:04,820
seven years.

403
00:21:04,872 --> 00:21:08,073
Must be in his 50s,
maybe has kids,

404
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,993
divorced, second
wife, more kids,

405
00:21:10,995 --> 00:21:12,628
and I wonder,

406
00:21:12,663 --> 00:21:15,497
what must he think of himself?

407
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,499
His life's potential reached

408
00:21:17,551 --> 00:21:19,551
at a 30 grand a year salary,

409
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:22,504
an economy car he
still owes money on,

410
00:21:22,556 --> 00:21:24,556
two-bedroom apartment,

411
00:21:24,592 --> 00:21:28,093
child support, coupons.

412
00:21:28,145 --> 00:21:30,179
I couldn't bear it,

413
00:21:30,231 --> 00:21:32,931
a life like that.

414
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,100
The life of an
ordinary cockroach

415
00:21:35,152 --> 00:21:38,270
whose biggest value
is to serve me salad.

416
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:21,530
I have to go to the bathroom.

417
00:22:47,525 --> 00:22:49,024
Goddamn
withdrawals again.

418
00:22:49,060 --> 00:22:50,859
Or is it Tyrell Wellick?

419
00:22:50,895 --> 00:22:51,894
Is he toying with me?

420
00:22:51,896 --> 00:22:53,896
What kind of game
are we playing?

421
00:22:57,451 --> 00:22:58,784
Am I his malware?

422
00:23:49,203 --> 00:23:51,537
I had to wash my face.

423
00:23:51,589 --> 00:23:54,089
Hard to breathe...

424
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:55,340
here.

425
00:23:55,376 --> 00:23:57,626
I know you framed Terry Colby.

426
00:23:59,964 --> 00:24:01,096
I-I didn't.

427
00:24:01,132 --> 00:24:03,465
Your father worked at
Evil Corp before he died.

428
00:24:03,517 --> 00:24:05,517
That's a matter
of public record.

429
00:24:17,314 --> 00:24:20,365
I'm not turning you in, if
that's what you're thinking.

430
00:24:20,401 --> 00:24:22,785
I don't even have proof,

431
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:25,237
and even if I did,
I don't care.

432
00:24:25,289 --> 00:24:27,623
Just wanted to know
your weakness.

433
00:24:27,658 --> 00:24:30,325
Now I do.

434
00:24:30,377 --> 00:24:32,161
Revenge.

435
00:24:34,165 --> 00:24:36,665
How ordinary.

436
00:24:36,717 --> 00:24:39,501
Just like our waiter.

437
00:24:39,553 --> 00:24:41,753
But even extraordinary people,

438
00:24:41,806 --> 00:24:43,505
and I believe you are,

439
00:24:43,507 --> 00:24:45,891
are driven by
human banalities.

440
00:24:45,926 --> 00:24:49,011
And unfortunately,
we're all human.

441
00:24:49,013 --> 00:24:51,013
Except me, of course.

442
00:24:54,568 --> 00:24:56,351
I'm joking, Elliot.

443
00:24:56,353 --> 00:25:00,155
Enjoy your long
drive back home.

444
00:25:00,191 --> 00:25:02,878
I'm having a helicopter
take me back to New York.

445
00:25:04,078 --> 00:25:05,744
You take care, Elliot.

446
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:41,319
_

447
00:25:41,398 --> 00:25:44,891
_

448
00:25:49,344 --> 00:25:50,819
_

449
00:25:54,706 --> 00:25:57,410
_

450
00:25:57,669 --> 00:25:59,203
No. Bullshit.

451
00:25:59,906 --> 00:26:01,684
Dude, bullshit!

452
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:03,140
- What did they say?
- I don't know.

453
00:26:03,176 --> 00:26:05,342
Basically that they're a
bunch of dickless assholes.

454
00:26:05,378 --> 00:26:07,044
- Where are you going?
- To fix it.

455
00:26:07,079 --> 00:26:09,413
No one else is going to.

456
00:26:09,465 --> 00:26:11,465
Darlene, wait.

457
00:26:14,837 --> 00:26:16,921
I really don't think you
should keep pushing them.

458
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:18,088
Put it this way.

459
00:26:18,141 --> 00:26:21,142
Either I'm fixing
this or breaking it.

460
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:22,593
Their call.

461
00:26:34,657 --> 00:26:37,107
Hi, Pumpkin.

462
00:26:37,109 --> 00:26:38,909
Hey, Daddy.

463
00:26:38,945 --> 00:26:43,477
- Why aren't you at work?
- I broke up with Ollie.

464
00:26:43,866 --> 00:26:45,115
I know.

465
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:47,835
Just got off the
phone with him.

466
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,003
Come on.

467
00:26:49,038 --> 00:26:51,455
He was sobbing.

468
00:26:51,457 --> 00:26:53,841
He wanted me to tell
you something like,

469
00:26:53,876 --> 00:26:55,626
"I'll always love you.

470
00:26:55,628 --> 00:26:56,877
Please come back."

471
00:26:56,929 --> 00:27:00,714
And he can learn to forgive you.

472
00:27:00,766 --> 00:27:03,684
Jesus.

473
00:27:03,719 --> 00:27:05,841
- What did you say?
- I told him I thought you

474
00:27:05,842 --> 00:27:08,399
should've broken up with him a
long time ago and hung up on him.

475
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:10,975
Nice.

476
00:27:11,027 --> 00:27:17,778
- What did he mean, anyway?
- Just normal work and...

477
00:27:18,784 --> 00:27:20,284
money stuff.

478
00:27:22,288 --> 00:27:25,739
And, well, he cheated on me,

479
00:27:25,791 --> 00:27:27,157
so there's that.

480
00:27:27,210 --> 00:27:30,411
Well, the cheating part,
I'm not surprised.

481
00:27:32,415 --> 00:27:35,165
Not trying to make you feel
bad, honey, but come on.

482
00:27:35,167 --> 00:27:36,834
The kid's a douchebag.

483
00:27:39,171 --> 00:27:41,505
- As for the money...
- Dad, no.

484
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:44,508
I'll float you some money
for professional development.

485
00:27:44,510 --> 00:27:47,511
- Dad...
- Call it a loan,

486
00:27:47,513 --> 00:27:50,431
but do not pay me back.

487
00:27:50,483 --> 00:27:51,849
And you'll stay
here and commute

488
00:27:51,901 --> 00:27:53,517
until you can save
for an apartment.

489
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,185
I can't make you
do any of that.

490
00:27:55,238 --> 00:27:57,071
And you didn't.

491
00:27:57,106 --> 00:27:59,657
It's what I want.

492
00:27:59,692 --> 00:28:02,887
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

493
00:28:02,888 --> 00:28:04,161
No, no. Sit, sit, sit, sit.

494
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:05,863
Relax.

495
00:28:05,915 --> 00:28:09,199
- What would you like?
- You don't need to cook for me, Dad.

496
00:28:09,252 --> 00:28:12,419
French toast coming up!

497
00:29:26,329 --> 00:29:29,663
Why are they backing out?

498
00:29:29,699 --> 00:29:30,998
This is a library.

499
00:29:31,033 --> 00:29:33,617
You want to discuss that,
go back to the IRC island.

500
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:35,953
They banned me
from the channel!

501
00:29:36,005 --> 00:29:37,121
What happened?

502
00:29:37,173 --> 00:29:38,622
We just owned Steel Mountain.

503
00:29:38,624 --> 00:29:40,207
We did our part, and
it went perfect.

504
00:29:40,259 --> 00:29:42,009
Come on, we both know that
shit didn't go perfect.

505
00:29:42,044 --> 00:29:44,261
Well, it doesn't matter!
They called it off.

506
00:29:44,296 --> 00:29:45,879
We pulled our side together,

507
00:29:45,931 --> 00:29:47,848
and your side called it
off like it was nothing.

508
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:49,633
You got your answer.

509
00:29:49,635 --> 00:29:53,137
You better tell your pal
whiterose to stop being a pussy

510
00:29:53,139 --> 00:29:54,688
and start growing a pair

511
00:29:54,724 --> 00:29:56,974
because we don't have time
to dilly-dally around...

512
00:29:56,976 --> 00:30:00,728
And now you're gonna talk
about this in the world?

513
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:03,614
Do you even care
who hears you?

514
00:30:03,649 --> 00:30:05,315
Face it, Darlene.

515
00:30:05,317 --> 00:30:06,900
It's over.

516
00:30:06,952 --> 00:30:09,403
Walk away.

517
00:30:09,455 --> 00:30:11,655
I can't go back to
my people with that.

518
00:30:11,707 --> 00:30:13,874
Tell me why.

519
00:30:13,909 --> 00:30:17,578
You said the Dark Army
was with us on this.

520
00:30:21,417 --> 00:30:25,052
- Between us?
- I'm not about to goddamn tweet about it.

521
00:30:28,507 --> 00:30:32,843
They were out before you
ever got to Steel Mountain.

522
00:30:32,845 --> 00:30:35,179
I don't know why. That's
all they said to me.

523
00:30:36,766 --> 00:30:38,432
I know you had your heart set,

524
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:39,850
but for real this time,

525
00:30:39,852 --> 00:30:42,736
just let it go.

526
00:31:02,664 --> 00:31:03,997
- I need seats mostly.
- No.

527
00:31:03,998 --> 00:31:06,100
I imagine it must be exciting
to work in government.

528
00:31:06,136 --> 00:31:08,169
It's like a spy movie.

529
00:31:08,463 --> 00:31:11,639
- Can you read my secret emails?
- No.

530
00:31:11,874 --> 00:31:14,508
My job is mostly paperwork
and bureaucracy.

531
00:31:14,544 --> 00:31:17,945
They always want more
than the technology allows.

532
00:31:17,981 --> 00:31:20,414
I don't even have time to
read your secret emails.

533
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:22,617
But it's a stopgap for me.

534
00:31:22,652 --> 00:31:23,784
I'm restless.

535
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:26,120
I'm always itching
for something else.

536
00:31:26,155 --> 00:31:28,322
There have been a lot
of something elses.

537
00:31:29,359 --> 00:31:30,391
For both of us.

538
00:31:31,995 --> 00:31:34,195
Before this, I
worked at an NGO,

539
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:37,398
and before that, I worked
at Microsoft for a year,

540
00:31:37,433 --> 00:31:40,134
which felt like a decade.

541
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:47,375
Your place is beautiful.

542
00:31:47,410 --> 00:31:49,210
I wish I could take
the compliment.

543
00:31:49,245 --> 00:31:51,245
The decorating is
Scott's domain.

544
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,880
- Really?
- Yes.

545
00:31:52,915 --> 00:31:55,216
- Very nice.
- Yeah.

546
00:31:55,251 --> 00:31:58,819
- Where's all the... the antiques from?
- They're...

547
00:31:58,855 --> 00:32:01,722
So they tapped you
for CTO, yes?

548
00:32:01,758 --> 00:32:03,057
They're 17th century.

549
00:32:03,092 --> 00:32:05,726
Don't be surprised.

550
00:32:05,762 --> 00:32:08,596
Suspicious is more accurate.

551
00:32:08,631 --> 00:32:12,800
I was beginning to wonder
why you set this dinner.

552
00:32:12,835 --> 00:32:15,536
Four people in the world

553
00:32:15,571 --> 00:32:17,605
know about my conversations.

554
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:21,942
Somehow you're number five.

555
00:32:21,978 --> 00:32:26,414
Then I'm exactly what
you need in a right hand.

556
00:32:26,449 --> 00:32:29,450
So that's what this is about.

557
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:31,385
Isn't everything
about something?

558
00:32:31,421 --> 00:32:34,021
Like, we were thinking
about, is it is it babyproof?

559
00:32:34,057 --> 00:32:36,791
Yeah, that's...
that's a consideration.

560
00:32:36,826 --> 00:32:39,093
If you were me,

561
00:32:39,128 --> 00:32:44,165
- would you trust you as your right hand?
- If I were you,

562
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:48,302
I wouldn't have even
let me in the house.

563
00:32:49,572 --> 00:32:52,339
We finished
everything upstairs...

564
00:33:05,788 --> 00:33:06,754
Hey.

565
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:08,122
Hey, it's me.

566
00:33:08,374 --> 00:33:11,659
- Is now a good time?
- Yeah.

567
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:13,094
I'm at my new job.

568
00:33:13,744 --> 00:33:17,131
- How's it going?
- Seriously, it's hard as hell,

569
00:33:17,183 --> 00:33:19,633
but I am getting
the hang of it.

570
00:33:19,635 --> 00:33:21,969
At first, it took me, like,
years to marry ketchups,

571
00:33:21,971 --> 00:33:23,721
but it turns out I'm amazing

572
00:33:23,773 --> 00:33:26,640
at upselling
expensive cocktails.

573
00:33:26,692 --> 00:33:28,225
I'm not surprised.

574
00:33:28,277 --> 00:33:30,478
And then when I have to
put together to go orders,

575
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:33,147
it's like bagging Molly, so
I'm, like, kind of an expert.

576
00:33:33,149 --> 00:33:37,318
- How are you?
- I'm good.

577
00:33:38,371 --> 00:33:39,703
Wow, I've never heard you say

578

00:33:39,739 --> 00:33:42,123
a sentence like
that before, ever.

579
00:33:43,326 --> 00:33:46,210
I did what I had to do today.

580
00:33:46,245 --> 00:33:48,796
Well, if you're
around tonight,

581
00:33:48,831 --> 00:33:51,165
come over and tell
me about it, okay?

582
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:53,584
I got to go.

583
00:33:53,636 --> 00:33:54,969
Okay, bye.

584
00:34:08,568 --> 00:34:11,185
You seem to know how
to drink your wine.

585
00:34:13,356 --> 00:34:16,857
I indulge in few things,
but I do love wine.

586
00:34:16,909 --> 00:34:19,854
- Yourself?
- In my other life,

587
00:34:19,855 --> 00:34:21,862
when I could drink for one.

588
00:34:21,914 --> 00:34:24,698
But even then I
had cheap tastes.

589
00:34:24,700 --> 00:34:26,867
It's safe to smell, though.

590
00:34:26,919 --> 00:34:28,002
Put your nose in there.

591
00:34:28,037 --> 00:34:32,623
* Mean a thing to me *

592
00:34:32,675 --> 00:34:34,395
You know, to me, it
smells like every wine.

593
00:34:35,878 --> 00:34:39,380
But I'd love to learn.

594
00:34:39,432 --> 00:34:44,051
Dried red fruit, fresh violet,

595
00:34:44,053 --> 00:34:46,720
lemon peel.

596
00:34:46,722 --> 00:34:47,855
Try it again.

597
00:34:47,890 --> 00:34:52,393
Smell and really...
really think about it.

598
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:55,396
I do smell lemon.

599
00:34:55,398 --> 00:34:57,148
- Sharon?
- Yeah?

600
00:34:57,200 --> 00:35:00,034
How do you not blow your brains
out being married to him?

601
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:01,485
Smell again.

602
00:35:01,537 --> 00:35:03,404
Excuse me?

603
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:08,742
- Shall I repeat the question?
- You're a guest in our house.

604
00:35:08,744 --> 00:35:12,413
A very honest one.

605
00:35:12,465 --> 00:35:14,331
Wow.

606
00:35:15,835 --> 00:35:20,554
I think I'll mistake what you
said as a joke in poor taste

607
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:23,174
and excuse myself
to the bathroom.

608
00:35:25,595 --> 00:35:28,145
I have a beautiful
vintage over here.

609
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:31,315
I would love to just
show you the label.

610
00:35:31,350 --> 00:35:35,569
* Just a tragic picture show *

611
00:35:35,605 --> 00:35:37,988
Let's see here.

612
00:35:38,024 --> 00:35:39,490
Nope.

613
00:35:40,493 --> 00:35:42,159
Nope.

614
00:35:42,195 --> 00:35:44,411
There's the one.

615
00:35:44,447 --> 00:35:47,498
This is my prized
possession, actually.

616
00:35:47,533 --> 00:35:48,866
Take a look at this.

617
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,421
* I'm begging you *

618
00:35:53,122 --> 00:35:56,090
I'm in here.

619
00:35:56,525 --> 00:35:58,692
Can I help you?

620
00:36:38,467 --> 00:36:40,767
Thank you for a
lovely evening.

621
00:37:01,554 --> 00:37:05,090
- Siege in Stormstout!
- Carcass Emblem!

622
00:37:06,726 --> 00:37:08,159
We got problems.

623
00:37:08,195 --> 00:37:10,960
- Is the Pi online?
- Yeah, we're in the whole system.

624
00:37:10,961 --> 00:37:13,242
We could deliver the whole
payload right now if we wanted.

625
00:37:14,568 --> 00:37:16,151
And yet I hear no applause.

626
00:37:16,186 --> 00:37:18,186
Applaud.

627
00:37:22,993 --> 00:37:24,142
You have to tell them.

628
00:37:26,428 --> 00:37:29,814
- What?
- We lost China.

629
00:37:29,850 --> 00:37:33,184
- I'm sorry?
- The Dark Army is bailing.

630
00:37:34,151 --> 00:37:37,554
- Why?
- They don't answer whys apparently.

631
00:37:39,226 --> 00:37:40,625
That's no problem.
We'll just call 'em back.

632
00:37:40,677 --> 00:37:42,735
- We'll set up another meet ASAP...
- Dude, did you not hear me?

633
00:37:42,736 --> 00:37:45,130
They've gone dark.
It's not happening.

634
00:37:53,773 --> 00:37:55,356
I know. I know.

635
00:37:55,392 --> 00:37:58,176
I get it, okay? I fucked up.

636
00:38:09,239 --> 00:38:10,989
Let's not wait, then.

637
00:38:11,041 --> 00:38:13,208
Let's do it anyway, just us.

638
00:38:13,243 --> 00:38:14,959
Let's do it right now.

639
00:38:14,995 --> 00:38:16,661
Okay? We execute now.

640
00:38:16,713 --> 00:38:18,713
We execute on our side and
trust that the Dark Army

641
00:38:18,715 --> 00:38:20,165
gets their shit
together and follows.

642
00:38:20,167 --> 00:38:21,833
Why do they get
to dictate terms?

643
00:38:21,885 --> 00:38:22,834
We dictate terms!

644
00:38:22,886 --> 00:38:24,219
We can go now.

645
00:38:24,254 --> 00:38:25,386
If we move forward
and they don't,

646
00:38:25,422 --> 00:38:27,589
China still holds all
the redundant information.

647
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,723
It will be pointless.

648
00:38:28,758 --> 00:38:31,509
And if we wait, it'll
also be pointless.

649
00:38:31,511 --> 00:38:34,062
Everything you guys did
today would be for nothing.

650
00:38:36,433 --> 00:38:39,234
God, are you crazy?

651
00:38:39,269 --> 00:38:41,819
It will have no effect!

652
00:38:41,855 --> 00:38:43,354
It'll take down their
network for weeks.

653
00:38:43,406 --> 00:38:44,439
They'll recover.

654
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,523
It would still hurt them.

655
00:38:45,575 --> 00:38:46,941
We don't want to hurt them!

656
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:49,194
We want to kill them!

657
00:38:49,246 --> 00:38:52,080
And neither will happen
if we do nothing right now.

658
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:58,286
- What are you doing?
- Take another step, and I'll do it.

659
00:39:00,207 --> 00:39:02,090
Think about what
you're doing, okay?

660
00:39:02,125 --> 00:39:03,458
All right?

661
00:39:03,510 --> 00:39:05,543
In a month, they're gonna
be up and running again

662
00:39:05,595 --> 00:39:06,878
with even better security.

663
00:39:06,930 --> 00:39:08,570
We are not gonna get
another shot at this.

664
00:39:08,598 --> 00:39:10,965
The revolution that
we've always talked about

665
00:39:11,017 --> 00:39:13,384
will be gone,
dead, and buried.

666
00:39:13,386 --> 00:39:18,139
We will have failed
because of you.

667
00:39:18,191 --> 00:39:21,893
Please do not do this.

668
00:39:29,653 --> 00:39:30,652
Is there anyone here

669
00:39:30,704 --> 00:39:32,904
who can communicate
with this woman?

670
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,430
Please.

671
00:39:59,432 --> 00:40:02,600
Tell me it's okay to execute.

672
00:40:20,587 --> 00:40:23,688
But we were so close.

673
00:40:32,732 --> 00:40:34,832
It's not over.

674
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:36,034
We'll rework it.

675
00:40:36,069 --> 00:40:37,735
We'll figure something out.

676
00:40:37,771 --> 00:40:39,771
We got this far.

677
00:40:41,641 --> 00:40:44,809
We'll find a way,
just not tonight.

678
00:40:57,290 --> 00:41:00,658
This is all my fault.

679
00:41:02,162 --> 00:41:04,078
Come on.

680
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,130
You can crash at my place.

681
00:41:17,143 --> 00:41:19,227
My father picked
me up from school one day,

682
00:41:19,262 --> 00:41:22,680
and we played hooky and
went to the beach.

683
00:41:22,716 --> 00:41:24,248
It was too cold to
go in the water,

684
00:41:24,284 --> 00:41:28,319
so we sat on a blanket
and ate pizza.

685
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:30,788
When I got home, my
sneakers were full of sand,

686
00:41:30,824 --> 00:41:33,758
and I dumped it on
my bedroom floor.

687
00:41:33,793 --> 00:41:35,159
I didn't know the difference.

688
00:41:35,195 --> 00:41:36,861
I was six.

689
00:41:36,896 --> 00:41:38,529
My mother screamed
at me for the mess,

690
00:41:38,565 --> 00:41:40,415
but he wasn't mad.

691
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:42,700
He said that billions
of years ago,

692
00:41:42,702 --> 00:41:45,036
the world shifting and
the oceans moving

693
00:41:45,038 --> 00:41:47,171
brought that sand to
that spot on the beach,

694
00:41:47,207 --> 00:41:49,173
and then I took it away.

695
00:41:49,209 --> 00:41:50,341
"Every day," he said,

696
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:52,960
"we change the world,"
which is a nice thought

697
00:41:53,012 --> 00:41:55,546
until I think about how
many days and lifetimes

698
00:41:55,548 --> 00:41:58,049
I would need to bring
a shoe full of sand home

699
00:41:58,051 --> 00:41:59,784
until there is no beach,

700
00:41:59,819 --> 00:42:02,186
until it made a
difference to anyone.

701
00:42:03,189 --> 00:42:04,889
Every day, we
change the world,

702
00:42:04,941 --> 00:42:07,725
but to change the world in
a way that means anything,

703
00:42:07,777 --> 00:42:10,561
that takes more time
than most people have.

704
00:42:10,563 --> 00:42:12,897
It never happens all at once.

705
00:42:15,068 --> 00:42:16,150
It's slow.

706
00:42:16,202 --> 00:42:17,618
It's methodical.

707
00:42:17,654 --> 00:42:20,822
It's exhausting.

708
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:22,874
We don't all have
the stomach for it.

709
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:54,305
- Hey, sweetie.
- I'm gonna go for a run.

710
00:42:55,308 --> 00:42:56,874
Nice.

711
00:43:06,953 --> 00:43:09,504
Shayla's got the dog.

712
00:43:09,539 --> 00:43:12,957
She doesn't shit
on her pillows.

713
00:43:12,959 --> 00:43:14,709
That's a plus, I guess.

714
00:43:29,392 --> 00:43:32,977
- Shayla?
- Hey, brah.

715
00:43:33,029 --> 00:43:36,531
Sometimes the universe
aligns perfectly.

716
00:43:36,566 --> 00:43:39,033
Here I am, locked away.

717
00:43:39,068 --> 00:43:42,537
Still, it brings
you right to me.

718
00:44:11,792 --> 00:44:13,975
