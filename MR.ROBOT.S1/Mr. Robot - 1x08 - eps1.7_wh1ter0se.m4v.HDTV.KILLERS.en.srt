1
00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:02,828
The redundant backups at their
eastern data center in China,

2
00:00:02,829 --> 00:00:04,732
the Dark Army is covering us on that.

3
00:00:04,733 --> 00:00:07,068
- We can go now!
- If we move forward and they don't,

4
00:00:07,069 --> 00:00:09,295
China still holds all
the redundant information.

5
00:00:09,296 --> 00:00:10,230
It will be pointless.

6
00:00:10,231 --> 00:00:11,890
If we can talk to
whiterose directly...

7
00:00:11,891 --> 00:00:13,788
No way he's meeting you face to face.

8
00:00:13,789 --> 00:00:15,727
You fools actually got your wish.

9
00:00:15,763 --> 00:00:17,596
I don't know why, but the
meeting's actually gonna be on.

10
00:00:17,631 --> 00:00:18,706
I'd tell you to be careful,

11
00:00:18,707 --> 00:00:20,732
but I know that's the
last thing you're gonna be.

12
00:00:20,734 --> 00:00:23,503
I had the sysadmin check that server again.

13
00:00:23,504 --> 00:00:25,070
Of course, there was nothing.

14
00:00:25,071 --> 00:00:27,289
I have no idea what there was
to even be suspicious about.

15
00:00:27,324 --> 00:00:28,991
Why do you have my work ID?

16
00:00:29,043 --> 00:00:31,376
I placed a malicious
CD in my work computer.

17
00:00:31,412 --> 00:00:33,128
I need you to do something for me.

18
00:00:33,163 --> 00:00:36,048
Our new Chief Technology Officer,

19
00:00:36,383 --> 00:00:37,716
Scott Knowles.

20
00:00:37,768 --> 00:00:40,635
Meet me tonight, on the roof.

21
00:00:40,687 --> 00:00:41,887
Cameras have been out since March.

22
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:43,655
No one will know.

23
00:00:47,027 --> 00:00:48,527
Stop!

24
00:01:19,075 --> 00:01:22,160
What if this all went away?

25
00:01:22,162 --> 00:01:24,412
The city.

26
00:01:24,464 --> 00:01:26,664
The money.

27
00:01:26,716 --> 00:01:28,333
All of it.

28
00:01:28,385 --> 00:01:31,803
What, like a zombie
apocalypse or something?

29
00:01:31,838 --> 00:01:34,422
More like a revolution.

30
00:01:34,474 --> 00:01:36,090
Last time we hooked up,

31
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:38,009
we agreed to check politics at the door.

32
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:40,178
There's no middle anymore.

33
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,397
Just rich and poor.

34
00:01:42,432 --> 00:01:45,183
Okay, this shit is way too
heavy for me this early.

35
00:01:45,235 --> 00:01:46,757
- I gotta go to work.
- Right.

36
00:01:47,054 --> 00:01:48,448
Solving the world's problems

37
00:01:48,449 --> 00:01:51,689
one spreadsheet at a time.

38
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:54,025
Hey, it's either suits
like me or the government.

39
00:01:54,077 --> 00:01:55,777
We all know how well they handle things.

40
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,246
Why can't the world
just take care of itself?

41
00:01:58,281 --> 00:02:01,082
Because the world is
filled with stupid people.

42
00:02:01,117 --> 00:02:03,418
And I get paid a lot to be smart.

43
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:06,554
Hey.

44
00:02:07,007 --> 00:02:09,757
There's not just the rich and the poor.

45
00:02:09,793 --> 00:02:12,260
There's you, in the middle somewhere.

46
00:02:12,295 --> 00:02:14,779
The consummate survivor.

47
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:49,774
I'm in a ballet class right now.

48
00:03:50,878 --> 00:03:55,547
No, Ollie, I can't talk to
you about this right now.

49
00:03:56,699 --> 00:03:59,033
I don't care, Ollie.

50
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:02,820
I don't care who you ran into

51
00:04:02,822 --> 00:04:05,790
or what he said.

52
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:08,827
I...

53
00:04:15,168 --> 00:04:17,051
Sorry.

54
00:04:17,086 --> 00:04:19,337
Tell me you're not getting
back together with him.

55
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:21,339
Jesus, no.

56
00:04:21,341 --> 00:04:24,926
No. Just leftover work stuff.

57
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:28,312
- Have you talked to Elliot?
- Yesterday.

58
00:04:28,348 --> 00:04:30,348
Seems like he's pulling himself together,

59
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:33,017
but you know how he is.

60
00:04:33,069 --> 00:04:35,202
It feels like I'm always worried about him.

61
00:04:35,203 --> 00:04:36,882
- You know?
- Yeah.

62
00:04:36,883 --> 00:04:38,757
He's had a shitty month.

63
00:04:38,792 --> 00:04:40,459
Or 20 years.

64
00:04:40,511 --> 00:04:42,094
Take your pick.

65
00:04:42,129 --> 00:04:43,378
Then why are we the ones

66
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,098
that always end up so stressed?

67
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,351
Try waking up in your childhood bedroom,

68
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:51,970
then taking Jersey transit for two hours

69
00:04:52,022 --> 00:04:55,807
to make a 7:00 ballet class in the city.

70
00:04:55,859 --> 00:04:57,609
Well, silver lining,

71
00:04:57,645 --> 00:05:01,563
- you get to see moi.
- All right, everyone, first position.

72
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:23,323
- Synced and corrected by skoad -
www.addic7ed.com

73
00:05:25,723 --> 00:05:27,255
I hurt Krista.

74
00:05:27,308 --> 00:05:29,725
I don't feel good about that.

75
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,810
I hope you're not mad at me.

76
00:05:31,845 --> 00:05:33,178
But you have to admit,

77
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,681
she's just like everyone else.

78
00:05:35,683 --> 00:05:37,849
Too afraid to peek over their walls

79
00:05:37,901 --> 00:05:40,902
for fear of what they might see.

80
00:05:50,531 --> 00:05:51,963
Not me.

81
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:54,282
That's what I do.

82
00:05:55,035 --> 00:05:56,734
I look.

83
00:06:14,855 --> 00:06:17,856
Did you get everybody back?

84
00:07:08,075 --> 00:07:10,075
Tell him to follow the proper commands,

85
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,110
or the sequence won't initiate.

86
00:07:24,007 --> 00:07:26,174
Using the backdoor we planted
with our Raspberry Pi.

87
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,844
Jesus Christ, man, how long have
you been sitting on all this?

88
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:30,512
I installed a patch four weeks ago,

89
00:07:30,547 --> 00:07:32,214
and I've been monitoring it daily.

90
00:07:32,266 --> 00:07:33,799
No rest for the wicked.

91
00:07:33,851 --> 00:07:35,434
I wanted to make sure it was all updated

92
00:07:35,469 --> 00:07:37,102
at the Steel Mountain locations

93
00:07:37,137 --> 00:07:39,054
before the meeting with whiterose.

94
00:07:39,106 --> 00:07:41,139
Yeah, those Airdream guys are so dumb.

95
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:44,559
Who has all their thermostats
phone home the same network?

96
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:46,311
I'll sync up all five locations

97
00:07:46,363 --> 00:07:48,313
so they heat at exactly the same rate.

98
00:07:48,315 --> 00:07:49,948
No offense, but I'll handle that.

99
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,135
You should take care of the alarms,

100
00:07:51,136 --> 00:07:53,318
so there's not a signal of
the temp raising in the vaults.

101
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,319
No, reroute

102
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,432
Airdream's traffic.
Make sure to erase and

103
00:07:57,433 --> 00:07:59,252
- and all signs of our activity.
- _

104
00:08:03,163 --> 00:08:04,913
- Where were you?
- I need a word.

105
00:08:04,965 --> 00:08:06,081
I gotta get to work.

106
00:08:06,133 --> 00:08:07,499
I'm not sure that's wise.

107
00:08:09,336 --> 00:08:12,087
- What the hell is that?
- They're following me

108
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:13,421
and they're probably following you too.

109
00:08:13,474 --> 00:08:15,006
They were on the subway, okay?

110
00:08:15,008 --> 00:08:16,258
Cisco's warned me about them.

111
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:18,510
These guys are dangerous, Elliot.

112
00:08:18,512 --> 00:08:23,098
The whiterose meet might not
go down the way we want it to.

113
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,516
Yeah.

114
00:08:24,568 --> 00:08:28,436
Well, I don't even know how to use a gun.

115
00:08:28,489 --> 00:08:31,523
Besides, I'm not even sure I'm
the one they wanna meet with.

116
00:08:31,575 --> 00:08:34,442
You're definitely the
one they wanna meet with.

117
00:08:34,495 --> 00:08:37,863
And when you do, you need to be careful.

118
00:08:37,915 --> 00:08:39,915
I'm serious, Elliot.

119
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:43,836
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling myself from your phone.

120
00:08:43,871 --> 00:08:45,337
That way we have each other's number.

121
00:08:45,372 --> 00:08:48,673
- Wait, Darlene, we don't do that.
- That's to protect fsociety.

122
00:08:49,084 --> 00:08:51,927
Okay, but we need to
protect each other right now.

123
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:26,328
Lose Darlene's number.
It's a rule for a reason.

124
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:29,497
Don't worry, I'm not gonna use it.

125
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:31,750
She's right about one thing.

126
00:09:31,802 --> 00:09:34,135
You're the one they want to talk to.

127
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:37,255
We can't afford any distractions.

128
00:10:04,153 --> 00:10:06,605
My boss invited me
to another retreat again.

129
00:10:06,607 --> 00:10:07,856
He's so obvious.

130
00:10:07,908 --> 00:10:10,408
Why don't you just kill me now?

131
00:10:10,444 --> 00:10:12,345
- Oh!
- Jesus, Blake!

132
00:10:12,346 --> 00:10:13,862
Were you fucking tiptoeing?

133
00:10:13,914 --> 00:10:15,447
God damn it, look what you've done.

134
00:10:15,499 --> 00:10:17,115
Watch where you're going!

135
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,783
- But you...
- Good morning.

136
00:10:18,785 --> 00:10:21,246
Not now, Elizabeth. Hold all calls.

137
00:10:21,247 --> 00:10:23,789
- Cancel any meetings. I'm busy today.
- But, Mr. Wellick,

138
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,790
Gideon Goddard is here to see you.

139
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,709
I'm sorry. He was very persistent.

140
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:31,853
- He wouldn't leave.
- Okay.

141
00:10:31,854 --> 00:10:36,484
- Okay, no, that's fine. Thank you.
- Do you want me to...

142
00:10:41,808 --> 00:10:44,142
Oh, yes, I'd love some coffee.

143
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,462
One of my employees confessed to

144
00:11:04,498 --> 00:11:06,665
breaking chain of custody
with the Colby dat file.

145
00:11:06,717 --> 00:11:08,800
Unfortunately, this admission

146
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,136
will render the evidence inadmissible

147
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,671
and Colby free of charges.

148
00:11:12,673 --> 00:11:14,339
Now before you say anything,

149
00:11:14,391 --> 00:11:17,431
I want to assure you that
Allsafe has doubled its efforts

150
00:11:17,432 --> 00:11:18,259
to find the hackers,

151
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,345
whether it be reconfirming
Colby's involvement

152
00:11:20,347 --> 00:11:22,313
or finding the real perpetrators.

153
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:25,233
We've air-gapped your private network,

154
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,601
implemented a honeypot,

155
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,836
reconfigured all the firewalls

156
00:11:28,837 --> 00:11:31,201
- and systematically...
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

157
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:35,635
- A honeypot, for what?
- A specific server

158
00:11:35,636 --> 00:11:37,696
involved in the last fsociety attack,

159
00:11:37,748 --> 00:11:39,581
CS30.

160
00:11:39,616 --> 00:11:42,200
I know we checked it out,
but if there's even a chance

161
00:11:42,252 --> 00:11:43,868
the hackers are still in the network,

162
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,122
the honeypot will ensure that
they can't cause any damage.

163
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:49,276
They'll log into the
decoy server we've set up,

164
00:11:49,277 --> 00:11:50,909
thinking they're on the main network.

165
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,417
And I'm personally keeping
tabs on all traffic.

166
00:11:53,418 --> 00:11:55,706
So you have our full attention.

167
00:11:56,043 --> 00:11:56,864
_

168
00:11:56,865 --> 00:12:02,015
- _
- Well, I appreciate your transparency.

169
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,700
- Well, so you understand then.
- Of course.

170
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:09,194
In fact, I'd like to
look over your findings,

171
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,862
especially this server.

172
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:16,142
- So, please send me the research.
- Of course, of course.

173
00:12:16,143 --> 00:12:18,236
Well, thank you again for seeing me.

174
00:12:52,742 --> 00:12:54,189
_

175
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,456
Mr. Wellick.

176
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:14,092
Mr. Wellick!

177
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:18,429
- I specifically asked not to be disturbed.
- I know, but...

178
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:22,015
- What is it?
- The police.

179
00:13:22,254 --> 00:13:24,135
It's awful.

180
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:28,305
- What about the police?
- They found a body on the roof.

181
00:13:29,077 --> 00:13:31,809
- A body? Who?
- They're not saying,

182
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:32,477
but detectives came by.

183
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:34,062
They want to speak with you.

184
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,227
- With me?
- They're questioning everyone

185
00:13:37,228 --> 00:13:39,901
who was at the reception last night.

186
00:13:47,327 --> 00:13:50,912
Clearly, this is tragic, but
unfortunately work goes on.

187
00:13:50,964 --> 00:13:55,505
- But don't you think you should...
- Tell them they can set an appointment.

188
00:13:55,506 --> 00:13:58,253
I'd be happy to speak with them then.

189
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,415
Oh, and, Elizabeth, I
need you to connect me

190
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,782
with the Dulles Server Farm.

191
00:14:05,783 --> 00:14:07,846
I'll take it on my mobile.

192
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:11,399
And the file shares?

193
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,600
'Cause client data is inaccessible

194
00:14:12,652 --> 00:14:15,353
- until we're back online.
- Jumping on that now.

195
00:14:15,355 --> 00:14:16,738
Check the logs on the ASA firewall.

196
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,356
I want a full report.

197
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,991
Ollie, sales.

198
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,526
All appointments at Allsafe

199
00:14:21,528 --> 00:14:22,861
are cancelled until further notice.

200
00:14:22,913 --> 00:14:24,696
Word of this cannot get out.

201
00:14:24,698 --> 00:14:27,532
All right, let's get to it.

202
00:14:40,002 --> 00:14:42,426
This
hack is far from devastating.

203
00:14:42,428 --> 00:14:43,978
They already own us.

204
00:14:44,013 --> 00:14:46,097
They're not going after anything valuable.

205
00:14:46,149 --> 00:14:48,099
This is more of a distraction.

206
00:14:48,101 --> 00:14:51,318
But what are they trying
to distract us from?

207
00:14:58,661 --> 00:15:00,611
Hey, bro.

208
00:15:04,642 --> 00:15:07,854
- Always the chatterbox.
- You're sweating.

209
00:15:07,855 --> 00:15:10,121
Oh, yeah? Yeah, maybe a little.

210
00:15:10,173 --> 00:15:11,922
Been running around.

211
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:15,487
Look, I sorta need you
to handle something for me.

212
00:15:15,488 --> 00:15:18,456
- What have they got you doing here?
- Trying to reverse engineer the malware.

213
00:15:18,457 --> 00:15:20,740
Okay, I'm gonna need you to stop doing that

214
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:22,133
and take these corrupted drives

215
00:15:22,185 --> 00:15:25,219
over to Blank's Disk
Recovery on 36th and 5th.

216
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:32,423
- Why me? Get one of the IT guys.
- Everyone is swamped, Elliot.

217
00:15:34,813 --> 00:15:39,683
Dude, this isn't, like, a debate.

218
00:15:39,735 --> 00:15:42,235
I've always wanted things
to be cool between us,

219
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:46,273
but I outrank you.

220
00:15:46,325 --> 00:15:48,608
So...

221
00:15:48,961 --> 00:15:50,077
Here are the drives.

222
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:52,713
Your appointment is at 2:00.

223
00:15:52,748 --> 00:15:55,666
You cannot be late.

224
00:15:56,113 --> 00:16:02,159
- In fact, how 'bout you leave right now?
- It's only 12:00.

225
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,642
Elliot, bro, just...

226
00:16:04,677 --> 00:16:09,063
just do me this solid, okay?

227
00:16:21,777 --> 00:16:23,410
He
wasn't just stressed.

228
00:16:23,446 --> 00:16:25,913
He was scared.

229
00:16:25,948 --> 00:16:27,748
Let's see what he's hiding.

230
00:16:28,588 --> 00:16:30,350
_

231
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:35,545
- _
- _

232
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:39,543
What does Angela have to do with this?

233
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:43,972
- _
- _

234
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:48,286
_

235
00:16:48,649 --> 00:16:53,493
_

236
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:56,689
_

237
00:16:56,864 --> 00:16:59,982
_

238
00:17:00,157 --> 00:17:06,400
- _
- _

239
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:08,200
_

240
00:17:09,204 --> 00:17:11,904
_

241
00:17:12,055 --> 00:17:13,750
_

242
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,716
_

243
00:17:15,872 --> 00:17:17,546
_

244
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:20,122
_

245
00:17:20,224 --> 00:17:22,059
_

246
00:17:37,342 --> 00:17:40,703
_

247
00:17:41,787 --> 00:17:44,416
_

248
00:18:14,356 --> 00:18:17,786
- Why didn't you tell me?
- And say what?

249
00:18:17,787 --> 00:18:20,311
"Hey, Elliot, there's a
bunch of nude pics of me

250
00:18:20,313 --> 00:18:23,075
- that some asshole wants to leak online"?
- I could have helped.

251
00:18:23,076 --> 00:18:26,789
- You weren't around.
- Yeah.

252
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,621
Kinda had a rough month.

253
00:18:31,657 --> 00:18:33,741
I'm sorry.

254
00:18:33,793 --> 00:18:39,041
- Tell me what happened.
- We were being pressured.

255
00:18:39,042 --> 00:18:42,817
- By who?
- Some guy.

256
00:18:43,302 --> 00:18:46,420
He gave Ollie a CD that
infected his laptop,

257
00:18:46,472 --> 00:18:50,724
stole his pictures, his
emails, and browser cache.

258
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:53,177
He said to install the disk at Allsafe,

259
00:18:53,179 --> 00:18:55,596
or he would leak everything online.

260
00:18:55,648 --> 00:18:57,231
It was a while ago.

261
00:18:57,266 --> 00:19:00,650
- I thought he forgot about us.
- I was right.

262
00:19:00,651 --> 00:19:02,269
The hack was a distraction.

263
00:19:02,321 --> 00:19:05,239
This is about me. This is the meeting.

264
00:19:06,659 --> 00:19:10,527
- You should have come to me.
- I told you,

265
00:19:10,579 --> 00:19:11,829
you weren't there.

266
00:19:11,864 --> 00:19:14,415
You're never there anymore.

267
00:19:15,785 --> 00:19:18,168
Something is going on with you, Elliot.

268
00:19:18,204 --> 00:19:19,920
You have not been the same
the past couple of months,

269
00:19:19,955 --> 00:19:21,789
and this happened before Shayla.

270
00:19:21,841 --> 00:19:24,842
- You're wrong.
- You're lying!

271
00:19:24,877 --> 00:19:27,628
You don't talk to me anymore!

272
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,463
Just tell me what to do here!

273
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:31,215
Because the only solution I can think of

274
00:19:31,267 --> 00:19:32,883
is to give up.

275
00:19:41,257 --> 00:19:48,559
- God, say something!
- You're right.

276
00:19:49,819 --> 00:19:52,903
We don't talk anymore.

277
00:20:01,747 --> 00:20:04,965
It's so strange.

278
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:07,718
I really miss us.

279
00:20:09,255 --> 00:20:12,256
Why is that strange?

280
00:20:15,311 --> 00:20:18,595
Because I never thought I'd have to.

281
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,316
Hackers.

282
00:20:23,352 --> 00:20:25,986
We inherently trust no one,

283
00:20:26,021 --> 00:20:27,938
including each other.

284
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,940
I'll never be able to tell her.

285
00:20:29,942 --> 00:20:31,992
There will always be this divide,

286
00:20:32,027 --> 00:20:35,078
my wall that she can't look over.

287
00:20:37,165 --> 00:20:40,216
And she knows it.

288
00:20:46,206 --> 00:20:48,004
Trust issues.

289
00:20:48,005 --> 00:20:50,171
The Dark Army has taken extraordinary steps

290
00:20:50,223 --> 00:20:53,341
to make sure this meeting's
exactly how they want it.

291
00:20:53,393 --> 00:20:57,011
Is that why the infamous
whiterose is such a legend?

292
00:20:57,013 --> 00:21:01,065
Because he's more paranoid
than the rest of us?

293
00:21:09,359 --> 00:21:13,027
I'm Elliot. Alderson.

294
00:21:36,186 --> 00:21:37,802
A Faraday cage.

295
00:21:37,854 --> 00:21:39,888
A room specifically designed

296
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:42,307
to prevent electromagnetic interference.

297
00:21:42,359 --> 00:21:47,862
No radio, no signal, no
WiFi, nothing to hack.

298
00:21:51,785 --> 00:21:53,952
I think I'm here to see you.

299
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,961
Am I supposed to follow you?

300
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,217
Are you just going to stand there

301
00:22:09,252 --> 00:22:11,753
or do you want to hand me those drives?

302
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:14,889
Mm-mm-mm.

303
00:22:15,926 --> 00:22:17,809
This meeting has started.

304
00:22:17,844 --> 00:22:20,812
I manage my time very
carefully, Mr. Alderson.

305
00:22:20,847 --> 00:22:22,430
Each beep indicates one minute of my time

306
00:22:22,432 --> 00:22:24,015
that has passed.

307
00:22:24,067 --> 00:22:26,434
I have allotted you no
more than three minutes.

308
00:22:31,107 --> 00:22:32,991
Are you really gonna do that?

309
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:35,243
I suggest you pick better
topics of conversation.

310
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:38,112
I have 17 more items on my agenda today.

311
00:22:38,114 --> 00:22:39,364
The Evil Corp hack,

312
00:22:39,416 --> 00:22:41,165
we should go through with it this time.

313
00:22:41,201 --> 00:22:43,368
You are turning out to
be a grave disappointment.

314
00:22:43,420 --> 00:22:45,420
We were ready. We had everything set to go.

315
00:22:45,455 --> 00:22:47,839
Dwelling is so inefficient.

316
00:22:47,874 --> 00:22:51,289
- Hey, you pulled out last time.
- Wasting more time,

317
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:53,011
telling me things I already know.

318
00:22:53,046 --> 00:22:55,346
But we were ready.

319
00:22:55,382 --> 00:22:58,132
That is the third time that
you have expressed that.

320
00:22:58,184 --> 00:22:59,217
She's trolling me.

321
00:23:00,971 --> 00:23:02,971
You have not advanced this conversation.

322
00:23:03,023 --> 00:23:06,107
- Do you intend to?
- Since last month,

323
00:23:06,142 --> 00:23:09,227
- Evil Corp has moved its tapes to five...
- Backup facilities,

324
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,446
and you have a plan to take them all down.

325
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:12,864
Yes.

326
00:23:12,899 --> 00:23:15,233
Finally, you have communicated something.

327
00:23:15,285 --> 00:23:19,241
- So are you ready to do this or not?
- You are the one who is not ready.

328
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,290
It was you who failed all along.

329
00:23:22,325 --> 00:23:24,158
What you've lacked was focus.

330
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:26,744
You strayed from the hack
to target Terry Colby.

331
00:23:26,796 --> 00:23:28,963
This opened a vulnerability.

332
00:23:28,999 --> 00:23:30,131
Suspicion.

333
00:23:30,166 --> 00:23:34,719
Specifically by Gideon Goddard.

334
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:39,363
- That's why you hacked Allsafe.
- To monitor his activities.

335
00:23:39,364 --> 00:23:40,842
And that's when we discovered

336
00:23:40,844 --> 00:23:44,762
that he turned your infected
server into a honeypot.

337
00:23:46,683 --> 00:23:49,350
Oh, 60 seconds and this
meeting will be over.

338
00:23:49,352 --> 00:23:50,685
Wait.

339
00:23:50,687 --> 00:23:52,687
The concept of waiting bewilders me.

340
00:23:52,689 --> 00:23:54,322
There are always deadlines.

341
00:23:54,357 --> 00:23:56,190
There are always ticking clocks.

342
00:23:56,242 --> 00:23:58,860
That's why you must manage your time.

343
00:23:58,912 --> 00:24:02,155
- I'll find a way to remove the honeypot.
- Until 16 seconds ago,

344
00:24:02,156 --> 00:24:03,948
you were not aware there was a honeypot.

345
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,250
This does not inspire confidence.

346
00:24:06,286 --> 00:24:08,002
- Wait.
- There's that word again.

347
00:24:08,038 --> 00:24:09,048
We'll take care of it.

348
00:24:09,049 --> 00:24:11,789
You know you could have told
us about the honeypot weeks ago.

349
00:24:11,841 --> 00:24:14,208
Every hacker has her fixation.

350
00:24:14,210 --> 00:24:16,878
You hack people, I hack time.

351
00:24:16,930 --> 00:24:19,380
So you should know that
when I set a time line,

352
00:24:19,432 --> 00:24:21,182
there's a reason.

353
00:24:21,217 --> 00:24:24,218
You have 50 hours and 23 minutes.

354
00:24:24,220 --> 00:24:26,804
At that point, when all parties are ready,

355
00:24:26,856 --> 00:24:28,856
we will initiate the hack.

356
00:24:28,892 --> 00:24:31,225
We'll do it.

357
00:24:33,063 --> 00:24:36,486
- Maybe next time...
- Understand something, Mr. Alderson.

358
00:24:36,487 --> 00:24:38,066
After I leave,

359
00:24:38,118 --> 00:24:40,118
you will never see me again.

360
00:24:40,153 --> 00:24:42,703
There are very few people in my life

361
00:24:42,739 --> 00:24:44,238
that I have enough time
to see more than once,

362
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,574
and you are not one of them.

363
00:24:51,548 --> 00:24:53,748
Trust me,

364
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:57,502
that's not going to matter.

365
00:24:58,672 --> 00:25:00,191
Why are you doing all of this?

366
00:25:00,192 --> 00:25:03,591
The hack?

367
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:06,401
Why are you working with us?

368
00:25:16,462 --> 00:25:18,882
50 hours and 20 minutes left.

369
00:25:18,883 --> 00:25:20,290
I need to figure this out.

370
00:25:20,291 --> 00:25:22,281
Gideon's been spying on me the whole time.

371
00:25:22,282 --> 00:25:24,592
Honeypot service order, shit.

372
00:25:24,593 --> 00:25:25,864
I gotta do that now.

373
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:28,483
Security token. Gideon's phone.

374
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:29,984
I need his phone.

375
00:25:30,036 --> 00:25:32,287
50 hours and 19 minutes left.

376
00:25:32,322 --> 00:25:35,406
Damn, she infected me
with her time paranoia.

377
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:37,270
We're all living in each other's paranoia.

378
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:39,412
You definitely can't argue that.

379
00:25:39,647 --> 00:25:41,980
Is that why everyone
tries to avoid each other?

380
00:25:42,032 --> 00:25:43,365
I need to calm down.

381
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,317
I wish I could be an observer like you.

382
00:25:45,369 --> 00:25:47,369
Then I could think more calmly.

383
00:25:58,314 --> 00:26:00,565
This is comfortable.

384
00:26:00,617 --> 00:26:02,283
Less stressful.

385
00:26:02,318 --> 00:26:05,203
In fact, I feel like I can see everything,

386
00:26:05,238 --> 00:26:07,355
know everything this way.

387
00:26:08,058 --> 00:26:09,441
Hmm.

388
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,492
Do you know more than me?

389
00:26:11,828 --> 00:26:13,661
That wouldn't be fair,

390
00:26:13,713 --> 00:26:16,831
my imaginary friend knowing more than me.

391
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:19,000
So what would you do now?

392
00:26:19,052 --> 00:26:22,303
We need a distraction
to get Gideon's phone.

393
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:32,513
Darlene, I need you to do something for me.

394
00:26:32,515 --> 00:26:33,764
She can help.

395
00:26:33,816 --> 00:26:36,024
- My boss at Allsafe, Gideon...
- Sometimes it's hard

396
00:26:36,025 --> 00:26:38,102
to listen to an explanation,

397
00:26:38,154 --> 00:26:40,188
even when it's from myself.

398
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,907
Especially when it's from myself.

399
00:26:42,942 --> 00:26:44,775
It would be so much easier

400
00:26:44,827 --> 00:26:48,029
to only pay attention when I needed to.

401
00:26:48,031 --> 00:26:49,530
To just...

402
00:26:52,202 --> 00:26:55,203
Arrive at the conclusion.

403
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:59,874
Is that what you do?

404
00:27:28,322 --> 00:27:31,323
100 large
MMS files to Gideon's phone.

405
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,991
Drained it.

406
00:27:38,653 --> 00:27:40,610
_

407
00:27:51,011 --> 00:27:53,679
Corporate greed is a trickle down desire

408
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:56,014
that reaches even the
bottom of the food chain.

409
00:27:56,016 --> 00:27:58,016
- And for what?
- What the shit?

410
00:27:58,068 --> 00:27:59,184
Wealth? Power?

411
00:27:59,236 --> 00:28:02,065
It's a pathetic fable, and you, Allsafe,

412
00:28:02,066 --> 00:28:04,806
- are a defender of this pitiful avarice.
- Holy shit, fsociety knows us.

413
00:28:04,807 --> 00:28:06,329
But your sweet dream is over,

414
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,995
and your nightmare is about to begin.

415
00:28:10,030 --> 00:28:12,364
We have won. Let those who are complicit...

416
00:28:12,416 --> 00:28:15,004
- What the hell's happening now?
- Those who aid the tyrants,

417
00:28:15,434 --> 00:28:17,669
those who accept the tyranny

418
00:28:17,705 --> 00:28:20,038
have no place in the new order.

419
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,291
The
distraction is momentary.

420
00:28:22,343 --> 00:28:25,415
- Hopefully all I need.
- They will know our justice,

421
00:28:25,416 --> 00:28:28,630
and we will show no mercy.

422
00:28:28,682 --> 00:28:32,050
Gideon Goddard, you are a lackey

423
00:28:32,052 --> 00:28:34,792
- to your corporate overlords.
- Someone shut this off.

424
00:28:34,793 --> 00:28:36,472
Defending those

425
00:28:36,524 --> 00:28:38,140
that bleed the innocent.

426
00:28:38,192 --> 00:28:42,127
- Serving them, slave to master.
- It's ignoring the remote.

427
00:28:42,128 --> 00:28:44,229
They hacked our smart TV.

428
00:28:44,231 --> 00:28:45,481
Congratulations, Mr. Goddard.

429
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,434
- It's posted to our website.
- And YouTube.

430
00:28:47,435 --> 00:28:50,369
You will soon be finished.

431
00:28:50,404 --> 00:28:52,488
In 90
seconds this code will change.

432
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,541
If I don't log in with it
on my computer before then,

433
00:28:55,576 --> 00:28:58,126
I'll lose everything to time.

434
00:28:58,162 --> 00:29:01,268
- We are exposing your role to the world.
- No, let it finish.

435
00:29:01,715 --> 00:29:06,908
And the world is very angry.

436
00:29:14,261 --> 00:29:17,346
We run from one deadline to the next.

437
00:29:19,099 --> 00:29:20,983
Where's Elliot?

438
00:29:32,301 --> 00:29:36,909
- What are you doing?
- I was working on the local backups.

439
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:41,254
- Why weren't you in there with us?
- I was worried about the...

440
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:42,538
It just doesn't add up.

441
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:44,089
All these events keep happening

442
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:46,008
around your appearance, your disappearance.

443
00:29:46,043 --> 00:29:47,259
- Gideon...
- Forget it.

444
00:29:47,294 --> 00:29:48,961
I don't wanna hear it.

445
00:29:49,013 --> 00:29:50,963
Every member in this
company stood in there,

446
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:53,298
watching the single worst thing
that's happened to Allsafe,

447
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,601
and where are you, at your cubicle?

448
00:29:55,636 --> 00:29:58,103
Doing what?

449
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:02,307
Uh, Gideon, I hate to interrupt...

450
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:04,488
- No, not now, Ollie.
- But Evil Corp's on the phone.

451
00:30:06,697 --> 00:30:07,813
I'll be back.

452
00:30:07,865 --> 00:30:09,982
We're not finished here.

453
00:30:15,673 --> 00:30:16,572
I know.

454
00:30:16,573 --> 00:30:18,958
You thought I didn't put the code in time,

455
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:21,961
but I had to hide it
quickly before Gideon saw it.

456
00:30:21,963 --> 00:30:23,345
Sorry.

457
00:30:23,346 --> 00:30:28,397
_

458
00:30:33,191 --> 00:30:36,058
Have I told you what I
saw when I hacked Gideon?

459
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:39,278
When I peeked into his secrets?

460
00:30:39,314 --> 00:30:42,698
I saw a good, honest man.

461
00:30:42,734 --> 00:30:44,450
Gideon was wrong.

462
00:30:44,485 --> 00:30:46,819
I am finished here.

463
00:30:46,821 --> 00:30:49,155
I'm no good for him or this place.

464
00:30:49,207 --> 00:30:52,124
He was only protecting his people.

465
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,203
- But me?
- _

466
00:30:54,204 --> 00:30:57,620
- I'm doing this to protect everyone.
- _

467
00:31:00,718 --> 00:31:03,586
Seems you've
been very busy lately.

468
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:08,591
I have to know what you're planning.

469
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:12,762
We were meant to be allies.

470
00:31:12,814 --> 00:31:14,764
We might just want the same thing,

471
00:31:14,816 --> 00:31:16,779
and I need to be involved.

472
00:31:16,780 --> 00:31:20,102
I'm pretty positive you're dead
wrong about that, my friend.

473
00:31:20,154 --> 00:31:23,689
I don't think there's anything
we could possibly agree on.

474
00:31:25,326 --> 00:31:26,776
I don't know what game you're playing,

475
00:31:26,828 --> 00:31:28,694
but I suggest you cut the bullshit.

476
00:31:28,746 --> 00:31:32,164
If there's nothing else,
I think we're done here.

477
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:35,618
Aren't you forgetting that I
know your dirty little secret?

478
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,254
There are people close to
you that wouldn't be happy

479
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:40,706
if they knew what I know.

480
00:31:46,631 --> 00:31:48,180
We're both too smart to allow pettiness

481
00:31:48,216 --> 00:31:49,382
to dictate our actions.

482
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:51,600
We're better than that.

483
00:31:51,636 --> 00:31:53,386
Weigh the pros and cons.

484
00:31:53,388 --> 00:31:54,804
Do what you need to do.

485
00:31:54,856 --> 00:31:57,106
As soon as the tabulations are over with,

486
00:31:57,141 --> 00:31:58,641
you'll know that telling anyone about that

487
00:31:58,693 --> 00:32:01,227
does neither one of us any good.

488
00:32:01,229 --> 00:32:02,528
In fact, you'll realize

489
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,280
that the only thing to do in your position

490
00:32:04,315 --> 00:32:07,283
when it comes to me is nothing.

491

510
00:34:10,525 --> 00:34:13,109
Good evening, Mr. Wellick.
I'm Detective Quattlander.

511
00:34:13,161 --> 00:34:14,777
This is Detective Jones.

512
00:34:14,829 --> 00:34:16,612
As I know you're aware,

513
00:34:16,664 --> 00:34:19,582
we were hoping to speak with
you at your office today,

514
00:34:19,617 --> 00:34:21,607
but your assistant said you're out.

515
00:34:21,608 --> 00:34:24,544
- What's this about?
- We're investigating a murder

516
00:34:24,545 --> 00:34:27,957
that occurred at your husband's
place of employment, ma'am.

517
00:34:28,009 --> 00:34:30,628
- May we please come in?
- A murder?

518
00:34:30,629 --> 00:34:32,131
_

519
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:34,296
Ma'am, do you mind
speaking in English, please?

520
00:34:34,348 --> 00:34:36,048
I think this is inappropriate,

521
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:38,100
you coming to my house like
this, upsetting my wife.

522
00:34:38,136 --> 00:34:39,823
- I will be in my office tomorrow...
- Mr. Wellick,

523
00:34:39,824 --> 00:34:42,555
as you can imagine this
is very time sensitive.

524
00:34:42,607 --> 00:34:44,557
We just need to ask you a few questions.

525
00:34:44,559 --> 00:34:47,109
Actually, both of you, since you were both

526
00:34:47,145 --> 00:34:50,062
in attendance at the reception last night.

527
00:34:50,064 --> 00:34:53,232
Yeah, I can assure you, we
have no information whatsoever.

528
00:34:53,234 --> 00:34:54,783
It will only take a moment.

529
00:34:54,819 --> 00:34:59,405
And you both did know the
deceased, Sharon Knowles.

530
00:34:59,407 --> 00:35:03,581
- You did know her, yes?
- Sharon Knowles?

531
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:07,546
That's terrible.

532
00:35:07,582 --> 00:35:09,248
Um...

533
00:35:09,250 --> 00:35:11,667
Yes, yes, we did know her.

534
00:35:11,719 --> 00:35:13,385
Please, come in.

535
00:35:22,763 --> 00:35:25,036
Have a seat. Can I get you anything?

536
00:35:25,037 --> 00:35:27,593
- Coffee? Tea?
- Coffee would be great.

537
00:35:28,094 --> 00:35:31,019
Tea. Herbal if possible, please.

538
00:35:35,576 --> 00:35:38,744
Mr. Wellick, what time did you last see

539
00:35:38,779 --> 00:35:43,449
Sharon Knowles last night?

540
00:35:43,501 --> 00:35:46,368
Mr. Wellick?

541
00:35:46,420 --> 00:35:49,338
Are you okay?

542
00:35:51,542 --> 00:35:53,542
Joanna?

543
00:35:57,798 --> 00:35:59,265
I think the baby's coming.

544
00:35:59,300 --> 00:36:02,134
We gotta get her to the hospital.

545
00:36:09,404 --> 00:36:13,998
_

546
00:36:21,985 --> 00:36:24,870
How'd it go with the climate control hack?

547
00:36:26,907 --> 00:36:28,540
Handled.

548
00:36:28,576 --> 00:36:30,909
I happen to be really
smart and good at things.

549
00:36:30,961 --> 00:36:33,128
Not like you give a shit.

550
00:36:43,924 --> 00:36:46,808
We should celebrate then.

551
00:36:54,768 --> 00:36:59,855
In 43 hours, exactly,

552
00:36:59,907 --> 00:37:04,109
our server will no longer be a honeypot.

553
00:37:04,161 --> 00:37:06,745
And that rootkit you wrote

554
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:10,532
will take down Evil Corp.

555
00:37:10,534 --> 00:37:12,668
We did it, Darlene.

556
00:37:12,703 --> 00:37:15,621
It's gonna happen.

557
00:37:17,374 --> 00:37:20,509
We're really doing this?

558
00:37:26,934 --> 00:37:29,851
Whoo!

559
00:37:29,887 --> 00:37:31,770
Oh, my God!

560
00:37:34,558 --> 00:37:36,608
Be happy!

561
00:37:36,644 --> 00:37:39,027
You did this.

562
00:37:39,063 --> 00:37:40,729
You did it.

563
00:37:40,781 --> 00:37:42,064
Just like that, Elliot,

564
00:37:42,116 --> 00:37:46,118
you're gonna change the world.

565
00:37:46,153 --> 00:37:50,465
- We did this.
- I would love to take credit on this one.

566
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,493
But I can't.

567
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:56,878
No, really, this was you.

568
00:37:59,667 --> 00:38:03,635
You are seriously the best person I know,

569
00:38:03,671 --> 00:38:05,721
you know that?

570
00:38:10,010 --> 00:38:12,427
I love you so much.

571
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:20,402
Oh, my God, Elliot!
What the fuck?

572
00:38:21,772 --> 00:38:22,904
I'm sorry.

573
00:38:22,940 --> 00:38:27,636
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I'm sorry.

574
00:38:27,637 --> 00:38:29,077
I'm sorry, I thought...

575
00:38:29,113 --> 00:38:30,779
I just...

576
00:38:30,831 --> 00:38:33,665
I'm sorry.

577
00:38:33,701 --> 00:38:36,001
Oh, my God, Elliot.

578
00:38:36,036 --> 00:38:39,538
Did you forget again?

579
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:42,541
Did you forget who I am?

580
00:38:44,928 --> 00:38:47,429
What do you mean?

581
00:38:47,464 --> 00:38:48,847
Forget what?

582
00:38:50,968 --> 00:38:54,936
Elliot, I need you to
tell me who you think I am.

583
00:38:56,106 --> 00:38:59,901
- What are you talking about?
- Tell me right now.

584
00:39:04,982 --> 00:39:06,982
What are you saying?

585
00:39:06,984 --> 00:39:10,152
Elliot.

586
00:39:12,122 --> 00:39:16,992
Of course I didn't... didn't forget.

587
00:39:16,994 --> 00:39:19,828
You're Darlene.

588
00:39:24,585 --> 00:39:27,969
You're Darlene.

589
00:39:28,005 --> 00:39:29,921
Elliot.

590
00:39:31,508 --> 00:39:34,176
You're Darlene.

591
00:39:39,650 --> 00:39:40,849
I know.

592
00:39:40,901 --> 00:39:42,601
I know what she's going to say.

593
00:39:42,653 --> 00:39:46,071
- I'm your...
- Sister.

594
00:39:49,693 --> 00:39:52,527
You're my sister.

595
00:40:14,435 --> 00:40:16,601
Darlene and
I'd hide in movie theaters all day.

596
00:40:16,637 --> 00:40:18,103
Darlene would sing Frere Jacques.

597
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:19,805
She rode her scooter in front of our house.

598
00:40:19,857 --> 00:40:21,390
I'm crazy. I'm crazy... crazy.

599
00:40:21,392 --> 00:40:22,891
She tried to run away in the third grade.

600
00:40:22,943 --> 00:40:24,559
How come I didn't remember this?

601
00:40:24,611 --> 00:40:26,695
Slept in the same bed when
our mom was mean to us.

602
00:40:26,730 --> 00:40:28,397
Why did I forget? I remember her voice.

603
00:40:28,449 --> 00:40:30,065
How could I forget? I'm crazy.

604
00:40:30,067 --> 00:40:32,728
I'm crazy... crazy... I'm
crazy... crazy... I'm crazy.

605
00:40:33,654 --> 00:40:35,070
Are you freaking out?

606
00:40:35,072 --> 00:40:36,788
Tell me the truth.

607
00:40:36,824 --> 00:40:38,740
Were you in on this the whole time?

608
00:40:38,792 --> 00:40:40,992
Were you?

609
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:44,579
Think, God damn it. Think.

610
00:40:44,631 --> 00:40:46,081
How can I just forget her like that?

611
00:40:46,133 --> 00:40:48,083
A whole person. A relationship.

612
00:40:48,085 --> 00:40:49,468
Is this amnesia?

613
00:40:49,503 --> 00:40:50,552
What else am I not remembering?

614
00:40:50,587 --> 00:40:51,753
I'm crazy.

615
00:40:51,755 --> 00:40:53,088
I should have stayed on the meds.

616
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:54,589
I'm crazy. I'm out of my mind.

617
00:40:54,641 --> 00:40:56,641
I knew it, I should have never created you.

618
00:40:56,677 --> 00:40:58,894
I should have listened to Krista.

619
00:41:02,766 --> 00:41:05,066
I avoid myself.

620
00:41:05,102 --> 00:41:06,435
Why?

621
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:08,103
I'm afraid.

622
00:41:08,105 --> 00:41:09,154
Okay.

623
00:41:09,189 --> 00:41:10,655
Afraid of what?

624
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:12,441
Finding too much.

625
00:41:12,493 --> 00:41:14,526
Too little. Nothing at all.

626
00:41:14,578 --> 00:41:16,611
Do I even exist?

627
00:41:16,613 --> 00:41:20,115
See me, Elliot Alderson.

628
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,750
I am here.

629
00:41:24,955 --> 00:41:27,923
Now I'm gone.

630
00:41:41,772 --> 00:41:43,889
We have to hack...

631
00:41:43,941 --> 00:41:45,941
me.

632
00:42:08,332 --> 00:42:10,632
Nothing.

633
00:42:10,668 --> 00:42:12,418
No identity.

634
00:42:12,470 --> 00:42:15,587
I'm a ghost.

635
00:42:28,588 --> 00:42:30,702
Did I erase myself?

636
00:44:24,969 --> 00:44:27,174
I think we should talk.
